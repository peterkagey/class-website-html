\section{Introduction}
(Leave this blank for now. Here's an outline of course topics for your reference.)

\section{Proof techniques}
(Here we give examples of some proof techniques.)

\subsection{[proof technique goes here]}
As an example of [proof technique], we will prove the following.

\begin{proposition}
  \dots
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \dots
\end{proof}

\section{Course objectives and student learning outcomes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Students will learn to identify the logical structure of mathematical statements and apply appropriate strategies to prove those statements.
    \item Students learn methods of proof including direct and indirect proofs (contrapositive, contradiction) and induction.
    \item Students learn the basic structures of mathematics, including sets, functions, equivalence relations, and the basics of counting formulas.
    \item Students will be able to prove multiply quantified statements.
    \item Students will be exposed to well-known proofs, like the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ and the uncountability of the reals.
\end{enumerate}
