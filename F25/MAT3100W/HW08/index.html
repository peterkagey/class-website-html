<p><em>Do all 10 points of the following required exercises.</em></p>
<h3 id="required-exercise-1-4">Required Exercise 1 [4]</h3>
<p>Here's a roadmap for your <a href="/F25/MAT3100W/proofs_portfolio/">Proofs Portfolio</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Draft 1 is due on Thursday 11/06, at the same time as HW09. You will upload a draft as well as your LaTeX code.
    <ul><li>A substantial part of Sections 2 and 3, including at least one proof or definition under each subheading.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Draft 2 is due on Thursday 11/13, at the same time as HW10.
    <ul><li>All of Sections 2 and 3.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The "semi-final" draft is due on Thursday, 11/20.
    <ul><li>A revised version of Sections 2 and 3, along with Sections 1 and 5.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The final draft is due on Friday, 11/28.
    <ul><li>A revised version of Sections 1, 2, 3, and 5, along with Section 4.</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>
For this problem, you should do the following:
<ol>
<li>Add all of the subsections to Sections 2 and 3, starting with <code>\subsection{Logic, truth tables, and De Morgan's laws}</code> and ending with <code>\subsection{Proof by contradiction}</code>.</li>
<li>Do (at least) one of the following: <ul>
  <li>In Section 2, add at least one definition, example, and/or theorem to each of subsections.</li>
  <li>In Section 3, make sure that each subsection (but not necessarily each subsubsection) has at least one proposition/theorem and corresponding proof.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post on the <code>#hw-prompts</code> channel on Discord with a screenshot of a proof that you want some feedback on, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.</li>
<li>Give at least 1 or 2 of your classmates feedback via the <code>#hw-prompts</code> channel.</li>
<li>Attach the latest version of your <code>portfolio.pdf</code> to the end of this document, <i>and</i> state a proof or example that you would like feedback on, and what you would like me to focus on when giving feedback. (This should be different from what you requested peer feedback on in Exercise 2.3.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="required-exercise-2-2">Required Exercise 2 [2]</h3>
<p>Suppose that $A_1, A_2, \dots A_{n+1}$ is a collection of sets and $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ is a collection of functions such that $f_i \colon A_i \to A_{i+1}$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}.$<br><br><em>Let $\circ$ denote the composition of functions so that $(g \circ h)(x) = g(h(x))$.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Explain why $f_1 \circ f_2$ is not well-defined (i.e. doesn't make sense).</li>
<li>Explain why $f_2 \circ f_1$ <em>is</em> well-defined, and state its domain and codomain.</li>
<li>Prove that $f_n \circ f_{n-1} \circ \dots \circ f_2 \circ f_1$ is a well-defined function, and state its domain and codomain.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="required-exercise-3-4">Required Exercise 3 [4]</h3>
<p>Why do we <em>care</em> about equivalence relations? Because they <em>partition</em> our set. A partition of the set $X$ is a collection of (nonempty) subsets of $X$ such that every element of $X$ is in <em>exactly one</em> of the subsets. In particular, if we partition our set according to an equivalence relation $\sim$, then two elements $a, b \in X$ are in the same subset if and only if $a \sim b$. We call these &quot;equivalent&quot; subsets <em>equivalence classes</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>If we look at the equivalence relation on the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, defined as $a \sim b$ if and only if $a \equiv b \pmod 3$, then we have three equivalence classes, which in abstract algebra we would describe with a slightly funny notation $$\begin{align}3\mathbb{Z} &amp;= \{\dots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \dots\} \\ 3\mathbb{Z} + 1 &amp;= \{\dots, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, \dots\} \\ 3\mathbb{Z} + 2 &amp;= \{\dots\}.\end{align}$$  Here $3\mathbb{Z} + 1$ is &quot;just notation&quot;: it's the name of a particular set.  Briefly explain in words <ol><li>three examples of integers that are in $3\mathbb{Z} + 2$,</li><li>how you determine which equivalence class an integer $n$ belongs to,</li><li>how you know that every number is in <em>exactly one</em> of these equivalence classes.</li></ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In abstract algebra, we refer to the group of "integers modulo $3$" as $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, where the notation means that we think of everything in $3\mathbb{Z}$ as being the <i>same</i>. This process of "quotienting" a mathematical object is ubiquitous in abstract algebra, topology, linear algebra, and other upper-level mathematics, and it all depends on the notion of equivalence</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now let $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and let $$R= \{(1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4)\},$$
which is to say that for $a, b \in X$, $a R b$ if and only if $(a, b) \in R$. <ol><li>Prove (or disprove) that $R$ is an equivalence relation.</li><li>Describe the two equivalence classes of $X$.</li></ol></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>A relation which is not an equivalence relation does not partition a set. Suppose that $X$ is a set and $R_1, R_2,$ and $R_3$ are relations on $X$. <ol><li>Prove that if $R_1$ is not reflexive, then $R_1$ does not partition $X$ into equivalence classes.</li><li>Prove that if $R_2$ is not symmetric, then $R_2$ does not partition $X$ into equivalence classes.</li><li>Prove that if $R_3$ is not transitive, then $R_3$ does not partition $X$ into equivalence classes.</li></ol></li>
</ol>
<!-- Let $X = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and describe three relations $R \subset X \times X$ on $X$ that are not equivalence relations, and state why they fail to partition $X$ into equivalence classes. <ol><li>Let $R_1$ be a relation that is not reflexive.</li></ol> -->

<p><em>Do 10 points worth of the following choice exercises. Make sure to tag the appropriate problems when you submit on Gradescope.</em></p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-4-3">Choice Exercise 4 [≤3]</h3>
<p><em>You get one point if you fill in at least three rows, two points if you write down five rows, and three points if you get all six remaining rows.</em></p>
<p>Find $R_0, R_1, \dots, R_7$ to fill out the entire table, being explicit about both your set $X_i$ and your relation $R_i$. Give counterexamples for each property that fails. It will be very helpful to consider relations on a finite set $X$ as a subset of $X \times X$, but use this trick on two rows at most.</p>
<p>I'll get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let $X_5 = \mathbb{N}_{&gt; 0}$ be the set of natural numbers greater than zero and let $R_5$ be the &quot;divides&quot; relation. While $R_5$ is reflexive and transitive, it fails to be symmetric because $1 \mid 2$ but $2 \nmid 1$.</li>
<li>Let $X_7 = \mathbb{R}$ be the set of real numbers and let $R_7$ be the equality relation.</li>
