<li>(2025-09-17T15:30:00) Choice Exercise 4.2 was trickier than I intended, so I added a hint in red, and made it worth four points.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="required-exercises">Required Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do all 10 points of the following required exercises.</em></p>
<h3 id="3-pts-required-exercise-1">[3 pts] Required Exercise 1.</h3>
<p>Set a timer for 15 minutes and spend the time reading <em>Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook</em> by Jay Cummings<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I recommend starting with Chapter 1, Section 2.1, Chapter 4, or Appendix C.</p>
<p>At the end of your reading, post to the <code>#hw-prompts</code> on our Discord server with a thought, question, or idea that you had while reading.</p>
<h3 id="3-pts-required-exercise-2">[3 pts] Required Exercise 2.</h3>
<p>Here's another \(\LaTeX\) tip: occasionally it is useful to include images (such as screenshots, photos, or images you find on the internet) in your document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In order to include images, you'll want to add a package. Type <code>\usepackage{graphicx}</code> up near the other packages at the top of your file.</li>
  <li>Start by creating or finding the image you want to include, and make sure it's a <code>.png</code> or <code>.jpg</code>/<code>.jpeg</code> file type.</li>
  <li>Put the file in your "local directory." If you're using Overleaf, you'll use the same button that you used to upload your template in HW00: <img src="/assets/upload_button.png" alt="upload button" class="inline-img"></li>
  <li>Make a note of the file's name and file extension, or rename it to something like <code>test_image.png</code> (making sure to keep the file extension the same as it was).</li>
  <li>Typically you want your image on a new line, so put a blank line in your <code>.tex</code> file, and below it type:
  <pre class="language-tex" tabindex="0"><code class="language-tex">
  <span class="token function selector">\noindent</span><span class="token function selector">\includegraphics</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span>width=<span class="token function selector">\textwidth</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>test_image.png<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Try the following settings for <code>[width=...]</code>, and discuss what they do:
    <ol>
      <li><code>[width=2cm]</code></li>
      <li><code>[width=5cm]</code></li>
      <li><code>[width=0.5\textwidth]</code></li>
      <li><code>[width=\linewidth]</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-pts-required-exercise-3">[4 pts] Required Exercise 3.</h3>
<p>I want you to read the following article while reflecting on three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the costs and affordances of using AI tools?</li>
<li>What are the values and purposes of going to college and getting an education more broadly?</li>
<li>What does it mean to flourish, both intellectually and otherwise?</li>
</ul>
<p>Start a stopwatch, and read the 3500 word article &quot;<a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/web-features/thr/posts/chatgpt-is-a-gimmick">ChatGPT Is a Gimmick: AI cannot save us from the effort of learning to live and die.</a>&quot; by Jonathan Malesic. (This is a college-level reading that may take you more than 24 minutes. At typical audiobook reading speed, this would take about 21 minutes to read.)</p>
<ol>
<li>When you're done write (a) how long it took you to read and (b) something that you liked, agreed with, disagreed with, or thought was relevant to your college experience.</li>
<li>On the <code>#hw-prompts</code> Discord channel, post a quote from the article, a criticism you had, or something that this made you think about.</li>

  <li>Let \(F_n\) be the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number, where \(F_0 = F_1 = 1\) and \(F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\). Prove that \(F_n < 1.9^n\) for all \(n \geq 1\).</li>
  <li>Use a proof by induction to prove that all integers \(n \geq 2\) can be factored into a product of primes. "Unwind" your proof to show the strategy for factoring \(n = 60\).</li>

<li>
  Let \(f(n) = n^2 + n + 41\). Prove or disprove that \(f(n)\) is prime whenever \(n \geq 0\) is not divisible for 41. (You can use WolframAlpha to check if a number is prime: <code>factor (100^2 + 100 + 41)</code>.)

<h3 id="5-pts-choice-exercise-8">[5 pts] Choice Exercise 8.</h3>
<p><i>Only attempt this exercise if you're feeling quite confident about how proofs by induction work.</i></p>
Here's a classic (incorrect) induction proof of the (obviously) false claim: "all horses are the same color."
The proof has a subtle error in it. Can you spot it?
<div style="border: 1px solid gray;">
<p><b>Claim: given any group of \(n\) horses, they all are the same color.</b></p>
<p>
  <i>Proof:</i>
  We proceed by induction, where the base case is clear: when \(n=1\), we have a single horse, and so all of the horses in that group are the same color.
</p>
<p>
  Assume (as an induction hypothesis), that any group of \(n\) horses is the same color for all \(n = 1, 2, \dots, k\).
</p>
<p>
  Suppose (as an induction hypothesis) that we have \(k+1\) horses, and we label them \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{k+1}\). By the induction hypothesis, we know that the \(k\) horses \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k\) are all the same color. Moreover, we know that the \(k\) horses labeled \(h_2, h_3, \dots, h_{k+1}\) are all the same color.
  Thus \(h_1\) is the same color as \(h_2\), which is the same color as \(h_{k+1}\), and so all \(k+1\) horses are the same color.
</p>
<p>
  Thus since whenever \(k\) horses are the same color, we can conclude that \(k+1\) horses are the same color, it must be the case that all horses are the same color. \(\square\)
