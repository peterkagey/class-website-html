<p><i>This assignment is worth 20 points. My goal is for you to spend ≤6 minutes per point on average. If you find yourself spending more than \(6n\) minutes on a \(n\)-point problem, reach out to me via drop-in hours, Discord, or email.</i></p>

<p><i>(Last updated: 11/8/2025, 12:49:27 PM)</i></p>

<h2 id="required-exercises">Required Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do all 10 points of the following required exercises.</em></p>
<h3 id="required-exercise-3">Required Exercise [3]</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Post to the <code>#hw-prompts</code> Discord channel with your favorite <u>choice</u> exercise that you've done this term along with (i) a screenshot of the problem, and (ii) a hint or thoughts on the problem in <i>spoiler mode<i>.<br> (The syntax for a hint on Discord is double bars <code>||</code> on each side of the spoiler like this: <code>Remember that ||1 + x < x + 2||.</code>)
  </i></i></li>
  <li>
    Do at least 3 points worth of choice exercises from previous assignments that you didn't choose for a previous homework assignment. If possible incorporate your solution into your Proofs Portfolio. <i>(You might look at the problems that other students liked on Discord)</i>
  </li>
  <li>Add <code>\usepackage{todonotes}</code> at the top of your document. Then choose one place where you would most like feedback, and before that section write <pre><code>\todo[inline, color=red!50]{Feedback requested. [Details of request go here.]}</code></pre></li>
  <li>Download the PDF, write <code>\includepdf[pages=-]{portfolio.pdf}</code> at the end of your document, and tag the Proof Portfolio pages for this problem.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="required-exercise-2-7">Required Exercise 2 [7]</h3>
<p>Welcome to your last homework assignment! In addition to the points in this assignment, you should also submit &quot;Draft 2&quot; of your <a href="/F25/MAT3100W/proofs_portfolio/">Proofs Portfolio</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The goal for Draft 2 is to have <i>completed</i> all of sections 2 and 3.
    <ul>
      <li>For the "Mathematical Concepts" section, you should have a definition, example, <i>and</i> proposition for each of the subsections (e.g
      "Logic, truth tables, and De Morgan's laws"), and each of sub-sub-topics (e.g. Venn diagrams) should appear in at least one definition, example, <i>or</i> proposition.</li>
      <li>For the "Proof Techniques" section, you should have a discussion of each proof technique, and at least two proofs per subsection (e.g. Direct Proofs). Every sub-sub-item (e.g. inverse statements) should appear in at least one proof. You can place the proofs in the "Mathematical Concepts" section and refer to them in this section or vice versa. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add <code>\usepackage{todonotes}</code> at the top of your document. Then choose one place where you would most like feedback, and before that section write <pre><code>\todo[inline, color=red!50]{Feedback requested. [Details of request go here.]}</code></pre></li>
  <li>Download the PDF, write <code>\includepdf[pages=-]{portfolio.pdf}</code> at the end of your document, and tag the Proof Portfolio pages for this problem.</li>

<h2 id="choice-exercises">Choice Exercises.</h2>
<!-- *Do 10 points worth of the following choice exercises. Make sure to tag the appropriate problems when you submit on Gradescope.* -->
<p><em>Choice Exercises will be posted shortly.</em></p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-10">Choice Exercise [≤10]</h3>
<p><em>Do any subset of the following parts, state which you did and how many points you are claiming for this problem</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[≤3]</strong> Email Prof Kagey (pkagey@cpp.edu) or post in the <code>#feedback</code> channel on Discord with a typo that you have spotted in this assignment or with a suggestion about how to make something clearer. (One point for every six minutes that the typo got you stuck, with a maximum of three points.)</li>
<li><strong>[≤2]</strong> Ask a question on Discord. (One point per question, up to 2.)</li>
<li><strong>[≤4]</strong> Answer a classmate’s question on Discord or give a hint about a problem on this week's assignment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> (Two points per answer/hint, up to 4.)</li>
<li><strong>[≤4]</strong> Can you generalize any of the above problems in an interesting way? If so say what the generalization is, attempt to solve it, say something about it, and say how many points you feel like your effort was worth, up to 4.</li>
<li><strong>[≤4]</strong> Choose one or more problems from our textbook or a previous homework assignment which interest you and write the problem statement along with an answer. Say how many points you feel like your effort was worth, up to 4.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Stop by student drop-in hours.</li>
<li><strong>[2 or 5]</strong> Work on at least one of the above exercises with a classmate. State which classmate you worked with and which exercises you collaborated on. If you've collaborated with someone for the first time, you get 5 points, if you've collaborated with someone before, you get 2 points for working with them again.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Turn in the assignment on time (without requesting an extension).</li>
