<h3 id="choice-exercise-6-4">Choice Exercise 6 [4]</h3>
<p><em>This is your programming problem for this week's homework.</em></p>
<p>The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is a database of mathematical sequences which currently contains 390048 sequences, with about 33 new sequences being add each day. One consequence of the structure of the database, is the even for &quot;two-dimensional&quot; sequences like Pascal's Triangle, we always have to input the data as a sequence. For Pascal's triangle, there's an obvious way to do it: read it by rows. </p><p>$$1 \\ 1 \quad 1 \\ 1 \quad 2 \quad 1 \\ 1 \quad 3 \quad 3 \quad 1 \\ 1 \quad 4 \quad 6 \quad 4 \quad 1$$
Thus OEIS sequence <a href="https://oeis.org/A007318">A007318</a> begins $$1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1, 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, \dots$$
However, for a sequence like <a href="https://oeis.org/A003987">A003987</a>, we have to be a bit more thoughtful. In this sequence, we're trying to describe the &quot;two-dimensional&quot; table $T(n,k) = n \oplus k$ where $\oplus$ is the &quot;bitwise XOR&quot; operator, which is ubiquitous in low-level computer programming, and in Python is written <code>n ^ k</code>.
$$\begin{align}&amp;0 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5\\ &amp;1 \quad 0 \quad 3 \quad 2 \quad 5\\ &amp;2 \quad 3 \quad 0 \quad 1\\ &amp;3 \quad 2 \quad 1\\ &amp;4 \quad 5\\ &amp;5\end{align}$$
The way we do it, is that we read the table by antidiagonals, letting
${a(0) = T(0,0)}$,
${a(1) = T(0,1)}$,
${a(2) = T(1,0)}$,
${a(3) = T(0,2)}$,
${a(4) = T(1,1)}$,
${a(5) = T(2,0)}$,
${a(6) = T(0,3)}$, and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a program that prints out the first $50$ terms of the sequence, $a(0)$ through $a(49)$.</li>
  <li>Write a program that prints out the first $5151st$ term of the sequence, $a(5150)$.</li>
  <li>Write a program that prints out the $m$-th term of the sequence, but without computing any smaller term. In other words, given some integer $m$, figure out how to determine $n$ and $k$ such that $a(m) = T(n,k)$, and then use this to compute $a(m)$.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-7-4-4">Choice Exercise 7 [4+4]</h3>
<p><em>Do any subset of the following parts, but for each part you do, attempt all subparts.</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>[4]
    In linear algebra, we write a <b>existence and uniqueness proof</b> whenever we prove that some set of vectors forms a basis for a vector space.
    <ol>
      <li>Write the definition of a <i>basis</i>, <i>spanning set</i>, and <i>linear independence</i>.</li>
      <li>Write an example of a vector space $V$ together with a spanning set $S \subseteq V$ such that there is a vector $\vec v \in V$ with the property that $\vec v$ can be written as a linear combination of vectors in $S$ in multiple ways.</li>
      <li>Write an example of a vector space $V$ together with a subset $S \subseteq V$ such that there is a vector $\vec v \in V$ with the property that $\vec v$ cannot be written as a linear combination of vectors in $S$.</li>
      <li>Prove that the set $S = \{(1,2), (-1, 2)\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ by proving that for every vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$, there <u>exists a unique</u> way to write $\vec{v}$ as a linear combination of vectors in $S$.</li>
      <li>Prove that if $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a vector space $V$, and we either add or remove a vector from $\mathcal{B}$, then it is no longer a basis for $V$.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>[4]
    In abstract algebra, we can define the rational numbers in the following way.
    <ol>
      <li>
        We define a relation on the set $X = \mathbb{Z} \times \left(\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\} \right)$ by saying that $(a, b) \sim (a', b')$ if and only if $ab' = a'b$. <ol>
          <li>Prove that this relation is reflexive.</li>
          <li>Prove that this relation is symmetric.</li>
          <li>Prove that this relation is transitive.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Now we introduce new notation: we write $\mathbb{Q} = X/\sim$, where $X/\sim$ means that we count elements that are related by $\sim$ as "the same". To explain why this makes sense, show that $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a'}{b'}$ if and only if $(a, b) \sim (a', b')$.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show that defining $(a, b) + (a', b') = (ab' + a'b, bb')$ is analogous to how we define $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{a'}{b'}$.
        </li>
      <li>
        Show that defining $(a, b) \times (a', b') = (aa', bb')$ is analogous to how we define $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{a'}{b'}$.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-8-4">Choice Exercise 8 [4]</h3>
<p>When I was a senior in college, I took the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition">Putnam Exam</a> for the first and only time. There was a question on the exam that—in a quite complicated and indirect way—led me to become a math professor.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set a timer, and spend $10$ minutes trying to make sense of what the problem is asking. In particular, try to explain why $f(3) = 8$ and $f(5) = 10$.<blockquote>
  Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers that are <i>not</i> perfect squares. For $n$ in $S$, consider choices of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r$ such that $n < a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_r$ and $n \cdot a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdots a_r$ is a perfect square, and let $f(n)$ be the minumum of $a_r$ over all such choices. For example, $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6$ is a perfect square, while $2 \cdot 3$, $2 \cdot 4$, $2 \cdot 5$, ${2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}$, ${2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}$, ${2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}$, and ${2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}$ are not, and so $f(2) = 6$. Show that the function $f$ from $S$ to the integers is one-to-one [an injection].
  </blockquote><cite>2013 Putnam, <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2013.pdf">Problem A2</a></cite></li>
  <li>
    Prove that $f(5) = 10$, and prove that $f(8) \leq 15$ by giving a sequence of integers ${8 < a_1 < a_2 < 15}$ such that ${8 \cdot a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot 15}$ is square.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set a timer, and spend $10$ minutes trying to prove that $f$ is an injection.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the timer goes off, find a <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2013s.pdf">solution writeup</a> for the problem, read it until you understand it, then put the solution away, and write up a solution to the problem in your own words.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-9-3">Choice Exercise 9 [3]</h3>
<p>In this problem, you will try to spot a somewhat subtle error in a (false) &quot;proof.&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Recall that given a set $A$, the power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is the set of all of its subsets. Write down the eight subsets of $\{1,2,3\}$ (and thus the eight elements of $\mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3\})$).
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the error in the following false proof.<br>
    <b>(False) proposition.</b> There exists an injection $f \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N}$.<br>
    <b>(False) proof.</b> Let $p_i$ be the $i$-th prime, so $p_0 = 2$, $p_1 = 3$, $p_2 = 5$, $p_3 = 7$, $p_4 = 11$, and so on. Then define $f \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N}$ as $$f(\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}) = p_{a_1}p_{a_2} \cdots p_{a_n},$$
    where $f(\emptyset) = 1$.
    (For example, $f(\{0, 2, 4\}) = p_0p_2p_4 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 = 110$.)
    <br>
    Because each distinct element $S \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ maps to a number with a distinct prime factorization, $f(S_1) = f(S_2)$ if and only if $S_1 = S_2$, therefore $f$ is injective (1-to-1).
  </li>
  <li>
    If there were such an injection, it would prove that the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is less than or equal to the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$, and thus $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is countably infinite. However, it turns out that the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is the same as the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$. Write a sentence or two about any thoughts, questions, or observations about this.
  </li>
