</ul>
<h2 id="choice-exercises">Choice Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do 10 points worth of the following choice exercises. Make sure to tag the appropriate problems when you submit on Gradescope.</em></p>

<li>The Putnam Exam is an extremely difficult college math contest which many years has a median score of zero. In this problem you're going to attempt Problem A1 from the 2005 Putnam.
<ul>
<li>Set a timer for 5 minutes and try to solve the problem:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Show that every positive integer is a sum of one or more numbers of the form $2^r3^s$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and no summand divides another. (For example, $23 = 9 + 8 + 6$.)</em></p>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-5-3">Choice Exercise 5 [3]</h3>
<p>In complex analysis, we define $i$ as the &quot;imaginary unit&quot; so that $i^2 = -1$, and thus $i^3 = -i$, and so on.</p>
<ol>
<li>We know that $$
i^0 = 1, \qquad i^1 = i, \qquad i^2 = -1, \quad \text{and} \quad i^3 = -i.
$$
Prove (by repeated multiplication) that $$
i^4 = 1, \qquad i^5 = i, \qquad i^6 = -1, \quad \text{and} \quad i^7 = -i.
$$</li>
<li>Prove that if $n$ and $m$ are positive integers and $n \equiv m \pmod 4$, then $i^n = i^m$. <br> <em>(Hint: choose $n \geq m$. Why can you do this?)</em></li>
<li>Compute $i^{919}$.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-6-4">Choice Exercise 6 [4]</h3>
<p>Andy taught me a cool geometric multiplication trick:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw the following and take a picture and upload it:
<ul>
<li>Draw the $x$- and $y$-axes and the parabola $y=f(x)=x^2$ for $-2\leq x\leq2$,</li>
<li>Choose two real numbers $-2 \leq x_0,x_1 \leq 2$, such as $x_0 = 1.2$ and $x_1 = 1.9$.</li>
<li>Draw points at $(-x_0,f(x_0))$ and $(x_1,f(x_1))$.</li>
<li>Find the $y$-intercept of the line connecting $(-x_0,f(x_0))$ and $(x_1,f(x_1))$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does your $y$-intercept equal the product $x_0x_1$? It should! Prove why this works!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-7-7">Choice Exercise 7 [≤7]</h3>
<p><em>Do any subset of the following, up to a maximum of seven points.</em></p>
<p>Prove the following divisibility tricks that you may have learned back when you were first learning arithmetic.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[1]</strong> Many of these tricks depend on the facts like $10^n \equiv 1 \pmod 9$ for all integers $n \ge 0$.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Let $n$ be an integer and let $s_n$ be the sum of its digits. For example, if $n = 7261992$ then $s_n = 7+2+6+1+9+9+2=36$, and note that
$$
7261992 = 7 \times 10^6 + 2 \times 10^5 + \dots + 9 \times 10^1 + 2 \times 10^0.
$$
Prove that if $3 \mid s_n$, then $3 \mid n$.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Prove the other direction: if $3 \mid n$ then $3 \mid s_n$.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Let $a_n$ be the <em>alternating</em> sum of the digits of $n$. For example, if $n = 7261992$ then $$a_n = 7-2+6-1+9-9+2=12.$$ Prove that if $11 \mid a_n$ then $11 \mid n$.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Prove that if $11 \mid n$ then $11 \mid a_n$.</li>
<li><strong>[3]</strong> Let $d_n$ be the number given by the last two digits of $n$. For example, if $n = 7261992$ then $d_n=92$.<br>Prove that if $4 \mid n$ then $4 \mid d_n$ <em>and</em> prove that if $4 \mid d_n$ then $4 \mid n$</li>
<li><strong>[3]</strong> Let $T_n$ be the number given by &quot;tripling&quot; $n$, so if $m = 19$ then $T_m=191919$.<br>Prove that if the number of digits in $n$ is NOT a multiple of $3$, then $37 \mid T_n$.</li>
<li><strong>[3]</strong> Prove that if the number of digits in $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $37 \nmid T_n$.</li>
<li><strong>[4]</strong> Take the last digit of $n$, double it, and subtract it from the initial digits. Prove that if this is divisible by $7$, then $n$ is divisible by $7$. (For example, if $n = 259$, you would do $25-18=7$, and thus $7 \mid n$.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-8-6">Choice Exercise 8 [6]</h3>
<p>Look up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a> puzzle. Prove that given a stack of $n$ disks, you can solve the puzzle in $2^n - 1$ moves.</p>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-9-10">Choice Exercise 9 [≤10]</h3>
<p><em>Do any subset of the following parts, state which you did and how many points you are claiming for this problem</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[≤3]</strong> Email Prof Kagey (pkagey@cpp.edu) or post in the <code>#feedback</code> channel on Discord with a typo that you have spotted in this assignment or with a suggestion about how to make something clearer. (One point for every six minutes that the typo got you stuck, with a maximum of three points.)</li>
<li><strong>[≤2]</strong> Ask a question on Discord. (One point per question, up to 2.)</li>
<li><strong>[≤4]</strong> Answer a classmate’s question on Discord or give a hint about a problem on this week's assignment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> (Two points per answer/hint, up to 4.)</li>
<li><strong>[≤4]</strong> Can you generalize any of the above problems in an interesting way? If so say what the generalization is, attempt to solve it, say something about it, and say how many points you feel like your effort was worth, up to 4.</li>
<li><strong>[≤4]</strong> Choose one or more problems from our textbook which interest you and write the problem statement along with an answer. Say how many points you feel like your effort was worth, up to 4.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Stop by student drop-in hours.</li>
<li><strong>[2 or 5]</strong> Work on at least one of the above exercises with a classmate. State which classmate you worked with and which exercises you collaborated on. If you've collaborated with someone for the first time, you get 5 points, if you've collaborated with someone before, you get 2 points for working with them again.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Turn in the assignment on time (without requesting an extension).</li>
