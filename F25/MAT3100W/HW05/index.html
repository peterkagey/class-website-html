<h2 id="required-exercises">Required Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do all 10 points of the following required exercises.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="required-exercise-1-5">Required Exercise 1 [5]</h3>
<p>Go to Discord and find the post in the <code>#hw-prompts</code> channel that is right before and after yours. (If you went first or last, wrap around to the beginning/end.) Read the posts and send a direct message to each of the classmates whose posts you read with four pieces of feedback, at least one of which is constructive criticism and at least one of which describes something you liked.</p>
<p>For your write-up in your document, write the names of the two people who wrote those proofs, the date of their post, and the four pieces of feedback you gave them.</p>
<p>If you got feedback from your classmates before submitting your homework, include that here too.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="required-exercise-2-3">Required Exercise 2 [3]</h3>
<p>De Morgan's laws (for sets) is a part of a larger pattern.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prove that for all integers $n \geq 2$,</li>
</ol>
<p>$$(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c \cap \dots \cap A_n^c.$$</p>

<h3 id="required-exercise-3-2">Required Exercise 3 [2]</h3>
<p>You're going to start your document for your Proofs Portfolio this term. Since this is a writing-intensive course, the <a href="https://academic.cpp.edu/senate/docs/AA008223ref_3.pdf">University Writing Requirement</a> specifies the amount of writing that you have to do over the course of the term. (This is over the entirety of the class, including your homework assignments and final project; it doesn't all have to be in your Proofs Portfolio.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Amount of Writing</b>: Students produce at least 4000 words (approximately 7 single-spaced pages/15 double-spaced pages, excluding references) of individually-composed formal writing that demonstrates upper-division written English proficiency within the course’s given discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get started, do the following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download this <a href="/assets/portfolio_template.tex">Portfolio template</a>, and save it as <code>portfolio.tex</code> in Overleaf or in your working directory.
  </li>
  <li>Choose a proof that you've written this term, replace <code>[proof technique goes here]</code> in the section header with the proof technique you used, type the claim in a <code>theorem</code> or <code>proposition</code> environment, and below that, copy/paste your proof into a <code>proof</code> environment beneath that.</li>
  <li>Download the file, and re-upload it, and save it as <code>portfolio.pdf</code>.</li>
  <li>At the top of your <code>HW05.tex</code> file, add <code>\usepackage{pdfpages}</code>. At the bottom, on the second-to-last line (right before <code>\end{document}</code>) add <code>\includepdf[pages=-]{portfolio.pdf}</code>. When you compile, your portfolio should be at the end of your <code>HW05.pdf</code> document. (When you tag Required Exercise 3 on Gradescope, only tag these last pages of your document.)</li>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-4-2-2-1-1">Choice Exercise 4 [2 + 2 + 1 + 1]</h3>
<p><em>Do any subset of the following.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>[2] Draw a Venn diagram illustrating $A = \{2, 6, 7\}$, and $B = \{1, 2, 9\}$, where the universal set is $\mathcal{U} = \{1, 2, \dots, 10\}$. Draw each element of $\mathcal{U}$ in one of the four regions. Take a screenshot or picture, upload it, and include it with <code>\includegraphics{...}</code>.</li>
<li>[2] Notice that two numbers are congruent $\mathrm{mod}\ m$ if they have the same remainders on division by $m$. (Where remainders are a little weird for negative numbers.) Find three positive numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ that have remainder $7$ on division by $100$. Use the definition of congruence to prove that <ul>
  <li>$a \equiv b \pmod{100}$,</li>
  <li>$a \equiv c \pmod{100}$, and</li>
  <li>$b \equiv c \pmod{100}$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[1] Find an integer $n$ such that $n < 0$ and $n \equiv 2007 \pmod{100}$. Use the definition of congruence to prove that $n$ indeed has this property.
</li>
<li>[1] Today my wife showed me a video of a bear in Türkiye eating some very expensive honey, and said, "If the Blue Jays win the World Series, then we should buy that really expensive honey." (Don't ask me why.) Write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of her statement.

<p>In fact, we can get <em>all</em> possible outputs! Because of this, when logic is done on a computer processor, it is often sent through a series of NAND operations.</p>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-6-5">Choice Exercise 6 [≤5]</h3>
<p><em>Do any number of the following parts, in order.</em>
It turns out that just like we can talk about two numbers being equivalent $\mathrm{mod}\ m$, we can also talk about two polynomials being congruent $\mathrm{mod}\ f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial.</p>
<p>The definition is what you might hope it would be!</p>
<ol>
<li>[2] We say $$p(x) \equiv q(x) \pmod{r(x)}$$ if...<br>
Guess what you think the definition is, then click below to get the definition. Compare and contrast your guess with the actual definition.
<details>
  <summary>Polynomial congruence</summary>
  We say that given three polynomials $p(x), q(x),$ and $r(x)$, $$p(x) \equiv q(x) \pmod{r(x)}$$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ such that $p(x) - q(x) = r(x)f(x)$.
</details></li>
<li>[1] Recall that if we're given two (positive) integers $n$ and $m$ and their decimal representation, it's easy to check $n \equiv m \pmod{10}$: just make sure that their last digits match up. What is the analogous rule when looking at polynomials $\mathrm{mod}\ x$</li>
<li>[1] Prove that $x^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{x^2+1}$.</li>
<li>[1] Notice that you can replace every $x^2$ with a $-1$ when simplifying a polynomial $\mathrm{mod}\ x^2 + 1$. Use this to simplify $x^4 + x^2 + 1 \pmod{x^2 + 1}$.</li>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-7-2-6">Choice Exercise 7 [2 + ≤6]</h3>
<p><em>Your programming exercise. The second part is worth one point for each 6 minutes you spend on this, up to a maximum of 6.</em></p>
<p>In Python, we have &quot;boolean&quot; values, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, and logical operators. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The operator <code>&amp;</code> (equivalently <code>and</code>) is a &quot;logical and&quot;, so <code>True &amp; False</code> (equivalently <code>True and False</code>) both return <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>The operator <code>|</code> (equivalently <code>or</code>) is a &quot;logical or.&quot;</li>
<li>The operator <code>not</code> is a &quot;logical not,&quot; so <code>not(True)</code> returns <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>The operator <code>^</code> is a &quot;logical xor.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>[2] Choose a programming language, determine the logical operators, write a truth table for five (inequivalent) logical expressions, and record the results here. (This doesn't have to have fancy formatting. For example, for <code>and</code> you can write the output of <code>print(True &amp; True, True &amp; False, False &amp; True, False &amp; False)</code>.)</li>
<li>[≤6] We can have a truth table which has three columns recording values, $P, Q,$ and $R$. This means that there are $2^{2^3} = 256$ different logical statements we can make up to logical equivalence. Write a program that outputs a logical statement for each different outcome.</li>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-8-3">Choice Exercise 8 [≤3]</h3>
<p>Matthew Scroggs has made a bot called Logic Bot on Bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/logicbot.bsky.social">@logicbot.bsky.social</a>), Mathstodon (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@logicbot">@logicbot</a>), and X (neé Twitter) (<a href="https://x.com/mathslogicbot">@mathslogicbot</a>) that tweets &quot;tautologies,&quot; logical expressions that are true no matter what the predicate values are. (The column in the truth table would be entirely true.)</p>
<p>Pick up to three statements that the bot has tweeted, and prove that they are indeed tautologies, making sure to show each step of your reasoning. (One point per tautology.)</p>

<li><strong>[≤3]</strong> Email Prof Kagey (pkagey@cpp.edu) or post in the <code>#feedback</code> channel on Discord with a typo that you have spotted in this assignment or with a suggestion about how to make something clearer.

<li><strong>[2 or 5]</strong> Work on at least one of the above exercises with a classmate. State which classmate you worked with and which exercises you collaborated on.
