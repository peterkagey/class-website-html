<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>You started your &quot;Proofs Portfolio&quot; on <a href="/F25/MAT3100W/HW05/#required-exercise-3-2">HW5 Exercise 3</a>, where you downloaded a $\LaTeX$ template.</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>Your portfolio will consist of five sections: an introduction, a discussion of mathematical concepts, discussion and examples of proof techniques, an overview of your final project, and a conclusion and reflection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>(You'll write this part last.) Your introduction will provide an overview of the entire document.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-concepts">Mathematical concepts</h3>
<p>For each mathematical concept, you should give all relevant definitions (using the <code>definition</code> environment), an example (using the <code>example</code> environment), and a proposition or theorem (using the <code>proposition</code> or <code>theorem</code> environments.)</p>
<h3 id="proof-techniques">Proof techniques</h3>
<p>For each proof technique, you should provide an overview of the proof technique and explanation of why the proof technique works. You should also give at least two examples using each proof technique listed. (Direct proofs, transformation of conditionals, quantifiers, existence and uniqueness proofs, proof by induction, and proof by contradiction.)</p>
<p>You are allowed to use proofs from your homework that you have written.</p>
<h3 id="final-project">Final project</h3>
<p>One component of your group project at the end of the term will involve writing up some details of your findings in your Proofs Portfolio. This section is likely to include definitions, examples, and</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-reflection">Conclusion and reflection</h3>
<p>In your conclusion, you will summarize the ideas and proofs in your portfolio as well as reflect on questions including but not limited to a subset of the following, adapted from Francis Su's &quot;<a href="https://www.francissu.com/post/7-exam-questions-for-a-pandemic-or-any-other-time">7 Exam Questions for a Pandemic (or any other time)</a>.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take one homework problem you have worked on this semester that you struggled to understand and solve, and explain how the struggle itself was valuable.</strong> <br> <em>In the context of this question, describe the struggle and how you overcame the struggle. You might also discuss whether struggling built aspects of character in you (e.g. endurance, self-confidence, competence to solve new problems) and how these virtues might benefit you in later ventures.</em></li>
<li><strong>What mathematical ideas are you curious to know more about as a result of taking this class?</strong> <br> <em>Give one example of a question about the material that you'd like to explore further, and describe why this is an interesting question to you.</em></li>
<li><strong>How has your mathematical imagination been enhanced as a result of taking this class?</strong> <br> <em>Give at least three examples.</em></li>
<li><strong>Consider one mathematical idea from the course that you have found beautiful, and explain why it is beautiful to you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For any problems you cannot solve on this exam, suggest a strategy you might try to tackle the problem, and show what happened as a result.</strong> <br> <em>Describe any strategic gaps you were unable to bridge, and list 3 helpful insights that may help another person trying to tackle the problem.</em></li>
