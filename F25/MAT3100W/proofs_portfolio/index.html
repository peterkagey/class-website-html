<h3 id="section-1-introduction">Section 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>In the world of mathematical research papers, the introduction is often considered the most important section, because it is the part of the paper that's most likely to be read. In your Proofs Portfolio, your topics are less focused than in a research paper, and so there will be less to say. However, an introduction should have at least one sentence for every subsection, and give a reader a sense of what to expect.</p>
<p>The goal of the introduction is to give your reader a sense of the topics you focus on and the reasons that you chose those topics. In a document like this, the introduction will not include any formal definitions or propositions, but instead will give your reader a sense of what to expect as they read the rest of the document. The goal is to welcome your readers into your work.</p>
<h3 id="section-2-mathematical-concepts">Section 2: Mathematical concepts</h3>
<p>For each mathematical concept, you should give all relevant definitions (using the <code>definition</code> environment), an example (using the <code>example</code> environment), and a proposition or theorem (using the <code>proposition</code> or <code>theorem</code> environments.)</p>
<p><em>You can put the proofs in this section and refer to them in the next section, or you can put the proofs in the next section, and refer back to this one.</em></p>
<h3 id="section-3-proof-techniques">Section 3: Proof techniques</h3>
<p>For each proof technique, you should provide an overview of the proof technique and explanation of why the proof technique works. You should also give at least two examples using each proof technique listed. (Direct proofs, transformation of conditionals, quantifiers, existence and uniqueness proofs, proof by induction, and proof by contradiction.)</p>
<p><em>You can put the proofs in this section and refer to them in the previous section, or you can put the proofs in the previous section, and refer to this one.</em></p>
<p>You are allowed to use proofs from your homework that you have written.</p>
<h3 id="section-4-group-project-write-up">Section 4: Group project write-up</h3>
<p>During weeks 14 and 15, you will be working on a group project where you explore a topic that we did not cover in the class. In this section, you will write about the topic in your own words. This section should contain roughly two pages of content and should include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An introduction to and informal background on the topic.</li>
  <li>All of the information in your class presentation, and any additional context or ideas that did not fit into your presentation.</li>
  <li>A minimum of at least one example, one definition, one proposition, and one proof—but probably more than one of each.</li>
  <li>At least one citation using <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX"><code>biblatex</code></a> or a similar tool.</li>
  <li>The final subsection of Section 4 should look like a miniature version of Section 5, where you reflect informally on how the project went, what you learned, what you found difficult, and what you want to know more about.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-5-conclusion-and-reflection">Section 5: Conclusion and reflection</h3>
<p>In your conclusion, you will reflect the ideas and proofs in your portfolio and on your experience in the class. This is a good place to talk about some of your favorite ideas from the class, and discuss any advice you would give to your past self (or future students) about mathematics, writing, or anything else.</p>
<p>To help guide your reflection, I encourage you to read the following questions, adapted from Francis Su's &quot;<a href="https://www.francissu.com/post/7-exam-questions-for-a-pandemic-or-any-other-time">7 Exam Questions for a Pandemic (or any other time)</a>.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take one homework problem you have worked on this semester that you struggled to understand and solve, and explain how the struggle itself was valuable.</strong> <br> <em>In the context of this question, describe the struggle and how you overcame the struggle. You might also discuss whether struggling built aspects of character in you (e.g. endurance, self-confidence, competence to solve new problems) and how these virtues might benefit you in later ventures.</em></li>
<li><strong>What mathematical ideas are you curious to know more about as a result of taking this class?</strong> <br> <em>Give one example of a question about the material that you'd like to explore further, and describe why this is an interesting question to you.</em></li>
<li><strong>How has your mathematical imagination been enhanced as a result of taking this class?</strong> <br> <em>Give at least three examples.</em></li>
<li><strong>Consider one mathematical idea from the course that you have found beautiful, and explain why it is beautiful to you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For any problems you cannot solve on this exam, suggest a strategy you might try to tackle the problem, and show what happened as a result.</strong> <br> <em>Describe any strategic gaps you were unable to bridge, and list 3 helpful insights that may help another person trying to tackle the problem.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-checklist">Final Checklist</h2>
<p>Before you turn in your final draft, check for the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have at least one definition, at least one example, and at least one proposition related to each of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Logic, truth tables, and De Morgan's laws</li>
      <li>Sets</li>
      <li>Numbers and number systems</li>
      <li>Relations and functions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure that your paper contains every sub-sub-item:
    <ul>
      <li>Unions, intersections, complements, and set differences</li>
      <li>Venn diagrams</li>
      <li>Parity, divisibility, and modular arithmetic</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure your paper contains at least <b>two</b> examples of each proof technique:
    <ul>
      <li>Direct proofs</li>
      <li>Transformation of conditionals</li>
      <li>Quantifiers</li>
      <li>Proof by induction</li>
      <li>Proof by contradiction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure that every sub-sub item shows up in at least one proof technique:
    <ul>
      <li>Inverse statements</li>
      <li>Converse statements</li>
      <li>...</li>
      <li>Universal quantifiers</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure your proofs appear in either Section 2 or 3 and are linked to the other section. (Use <code>\label{}</code> and <code>\ref{}</code>.)</li>
  <li>
    Double check that you meet all of the section requirements. In particular, for "Section 4: Group Project," you should make sure you have done the following.
    <ul>
      <li>An introduction to and informal background on the topic.</li>
      <li>All of the information in your class presentation, and any additional context or ideas that did not fit into your presentation.</li>
      <li>A minimum of at least one example, one definition, one proposition, and one proof—but probably more than one of each.</li>
      <li>At least one citation using <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX"><code>biblatex</code></a> or a similar tool.</li>
      <li>The final subsection of Section 4 should look like a miniature version of Section 5, where you reflect informally on how the project went, what you learned, what you found difficult, and what you want to know more about.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure that everything is <b>written in your own words</b> or else cited with a <code>biblatex</code> entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that you are following typical writing conventions.
    <ul>
      <li>There should be "connective tissue" sentences motivating, explaining, and giving context to what you're doing. Your writing should never look like just a list of definitions.</li>
      <li>You should make sure that there is always at least one sentence between headers/subheaders.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="self-assessment">Self-assessment</h4>
<p>In the final subsection of &quot;Section 5: Conclusion and reflection,&quot; you should give yourself a self-assessment of each part of the grading rubric, including a proposed score for each part. Here is the rubric for the Proofs Portfolio:</p>
