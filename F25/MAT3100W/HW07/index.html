<code>\section{Introduction}</code>, <code>\section{Mathematical concepts}</code>, <code>\section{Proof techniques}</code>,

<li>Under the statement, use a <code>proof</code> environment to write a proof in your own words. You can copy-paste this from a previous assignment, but you should edit it to make it as good as you can. (You've gotten better at writing proofs since you wrote this one!)</li>

<h3 id="required-exercise-3-2">Required Exercise 3 [2]</h3>
<p>When I worked as a software engineer, we would occasionally have lunches where we shared &quot;stupid dev(eloper) tricks,&quot; where we might tell each other about a keyboard shortcut that we found useful, or an app that helped us to accomplish something, etc.</p>
<p>In the <code>#hw-prompts</code> channel, I want you to share a &quot;stupid proof trick&quot; about Overleaf, or $\LaTeX$, or a mathematical concept, or a class policy, or something you can do in Discord, or anything else your classmates might appreciate. This should be anything that you have learned along the way that you wish you had known sooner.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Discord, give a üëç react to any &quot;stupid proof trick&quot; that you found useful.</p>
<p>Here are three of my &quot;stupid proof tricks&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Discord, if you want to check that your LaTeX is going to render properly, instead of posting something in a channel on our server, you can direct message the <code>TeXit</code> user/bot to make sure that everything is working ok.</li>
<li>In Overleaf, if you want to use multiple cursors (which allows you to type/delete something in multiple places at once), you can <code>‚åò + click</code> (on Mac) or <code>ctrl + click</code> (on PC) where you want your next cursor.</li>
<li>When you're writing a proof by induction, and you're not sure if you've established enough base cases, you can try to use your inductive hypothesis/step on the first value of $n$ that is <em>not</em> covered by your base case, and check to make sure that your base case contains enough information to take the first step.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="required-exercise-4-1">Required Exercise 4 [1]</h3>
<p>I gave you some feedback based on your HW04 Exercise 1 response. Look over that feedback and do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the feedback to improve your proof, and include it in your Proofs Portfolio.</li>
<li>Write a sentence or two with thoughts on the feedback: did you find it helpful? Confusing? Did you disagree with anything?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="choice-exercises">Choice Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do 10 points worth of the following choice exercises. Make sure to tag the appropriate problems when you submit on Gradescope.</em></p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-5-2">Choice Exercise 5 [2]</h3>
<p>In class we proved that there are an infinite number of primes using a proof by contradiction, but we said proofs by contradiction are only used as a last resort! Use (strong) induction to prove that for all $n$ there are (at least) $n$ primes, and say why this implies that there are an infinite number of primes.</p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-6-3">Choice Exercise 6 [3]</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the first required exercise, you proved that $\sqrt 2$ is irrational. Use a similar idea to prove that the square root of $3$ is irrational: that is, $\sqrt{3} \not\in \mathbb{Q}$.</li>
<li>What goes wrong if you use the same approach to try to &quot;prove&quot; that the square root of $4$ is irrational?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-7-3">Choice Exercise 7 [3]</h3>
<p>In abstract algebra, we often study various &quot;binary operations&quot; that take two elements from a set and combine them to get another element of a set.</p>
<p>Examples of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>integers under addition $$+ \colon \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$$ (add two integers and get another integer)</li>
<li>square matrices under matrix multiplication $$* \colon \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2} \times \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2} \to \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$$ (matrix multiply two square matrices and get another square matrix)</li>
<li>polynomials under function composition $$\circ \colon \mathbb{R}[x] \times \mathbb{R}[x] \to \mathbb{R}[x]$$ (if $f(x)$ is a polynomial and $g(x)$ is a polynomial, then $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial)</li>
</ul>
<p>Prove that if $\star\colon X \times X \to X$ is a binary operation and $a \star b = b \star a$ for all $a, b \in X$, then $$a_1 \star a_2 \star \dots \star a_n = a_n \star \dots \star a_2 \star a_1$$ for all positive integers $n \in \mathbb{Z}.$ (A technicality is that you'll need to assume that the binary operation is <em>associative</em>, which just means that while you can't rearrange the terms, you &quot;collapse&quot; the values with $\star$ in any order you'd like.)</p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-8-6">Choice Exercise 8 [‚â§6]</h3>
<p><em>You have to do all parts of this to get credit for this problem.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>[n ‚â§ 4] Choose an integer $n \in {1, 2, 3, 4}$. Set a timer for $6n$ minutes. Read the book or another resource until the timer goes off.</li>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-10-1-3-4">Choice Exercise 10 [1 + ‚â§3 + 4]</h3>
<p>When I was a senior in college, I contributed my first sequence to the <a href="https://oeis.org/">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> (OEIS). I submitted my second contribution, sequence number <a href="https://oeis.org/A248122">A248122</a>, a few months after I graduated. For the second sequence, I used <em>recursion</em> to count the &quot;number of strings of length $n$ over a three-letter alphabet that begin with a nontrivial palindrome.&quot;</p>
<p>A <em>three-letter alphabet</em> $\{a, b, c\}$ just means that we only have three letters to use. A <em>palindrome</em> is a sequence of letters that is the same forwards and backwards, such as $aa,$ or $abba,$ or $caabaac.$ A <em>non-trivial palindrome</em> just means that we don't count one-letter words ($a$ or $b$ or $c$) as palindromes, even though they are the same forwards and backwards.</p>
<ol>
<li>[1] Give examples of the following:
<ul>
<li>All $5$ length-$3$ words that begin with $a$ and begin with a non-trivial palindrome.</li>
<li>All $4$ length-$3$ words that begin with $a$ but do <em>not</em> begin with a non-trivial palindrome.</li>
<li>A $7$-letter word that does not begin with a non-trivial palindrome.</li>
<li>A non-trivial palindrome at the beginning of $abbccaccbbacbacbccbcc$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[‚â§3] Perhaps my first original proof was that the number of such words of length $n$ was given by the formula $$\begin{align*}a(0) &amp;= a(1) = 0, \text{ and}\\ a(n) &amp;= 3a(n-1) + 3^{\lceil n/2 \rceil} - a(\lceil n/2 \rceil)\text{ for } n \geq 2 \text{,} \end{align*}$$ where if $x \in \mathbb{R}$ then the <em>ceiling</em> of $x$ is written $\lceil x \rceil$ and is the least integer greater than or equal to $x$. (For example, $\lceil 7.26 \rceil = 8$ and $\lceil 9 \rceil = 9$.)
<ul>
<li>Compute (by hand) $\lceil 3.1415926 \rceil$, $\lceil 3100 \rceil$, and $\lceil -9.19 \rceil$.</li>
<li>Start a stopwatch, and try to write a computer program that will compute $a(26) = 1833980928771.$ You get $n$ points for each $\lceil n/9 \rceil$ points you spend on the problem, with a maximum of three points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[4] Recursion and induction are essentially the same idea. Use induction to prove that the formula is correct.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-11-10-pt">Choice Exercise 11 [‚â§10 pt]</h3>
<ol>
<li>[2] Watch (at least) the first 20:18 of the Numberphile video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bylFzBxzQ9M">Epic Induction</a>, which determines the possible number of little squares you can split a big square into.</li>
<li>[1] Recap the argument starting at 16:10 showing that you cannot split a square into three squares.</li>
<li>[1] Recap the argument starting at 17:28 showing that you cannot split a square into five squares.</li>
<li>[2] In your own words, write up a proof showing that you cannot split a square into two squares.</li>
