</ul>

<p><i>This assignment is worth 20 points. My goal is for you to spend ≤6 minutes per point on average. If you find yourself spending more than \(6n\) minutes on a \(n\)-point problem, reach out to me via drop-in hours, Discord, or email.</i></p>

<h2 id="required-exercises">Required Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do all 10 points of the following required exercises.</em></p>
<h3 id="required-exercise-1-4">Required Exercise 1 [4]</h3>
<p><em>While you get four points of homework credit for this exercise, I expect it will take students longer than 24 minutes, unless you have already been putting extra time into writing your Proofs Portfolio.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft 1 should contain a substantial part of Sections 2 and 3, including at least one definition or proof under each subheading in these sections.</li>
<li>This draft should also make use of the package <code>hyperref</code> and make use of at least three instances of <code>\label{...}</code> and <code>\ref{...}</code>. Additionally, you should  <code>\usepackage{hyperref}</code> to create internal links in your PDF. (These links might not work when you <code>\includepdf</code>, but they should work for your final portfolio submission.) As a more sophisticated option, you can use <code>\usepackage{cleverref}</code>, together with <code>\label{...}</code> and <code>\Cref{...}</code>.</li>
<li>You should bring a copy of your portfolio to class on Monday, November 10th in a way that you can share with classmates in order to get feedback. (Printing is preferred, but you can also share documents via a tablet, etc.)</li>
<li>Draft 1 of your Proofs Portfolio is due at the same time as HW09. Attach your latest <code>portfolio.pdf</code> to the end of this document using <code>\includepdf[pages=-]{portfolio.pdf}</code> as before, and tag it when you tag this exercise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="required-exercise-2-3">Required Exercise 2 [3]</h3>
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> A function $f \colon A \to B$ is a bijection if and only if there exists a function $g \colon B \to A$ such that
$g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a \in A$ and
$f(g(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$.</p>
<p>(Such a function $g$ is called the <em>inverse function</em> of $f$ and is denoted $g = f^{-1}$.)</p>

<p>Prove the &quot;backward direction&quot; of the proposition by assuming that $f^{-1} \colon B \to A$ is an inverse function of $f$, and concluding that $f$ is surjective and injective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this part, you will explore why we need to assume that <strong>both</strong> $g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a \in A$ and $f(g(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$ in order to conclude that $f$ is a bijection. </p><ol><li>Give an example of (nonempty) sets $A$ and $B$ together with a pair of functions $f\colon A \to B$ and $g\colon B \to A$ where <ol><li>$g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a \in A$,</li><li>there exists $b \in B$ such that $f(g(b)) \neq b$, and</li><li>$f$ is not a bijection.</li></ol></li><li>Give an example of (nonempty) sets $A$ and $B$ together with a pair of functions $f\colon A \to B$ and $g\colon B \to A$ where <ol><li>there exists $a \in A$ such that $g(f(a)) \neq a$,</li><li>$f(g(b)) = b$ for all $b \in B$, and</li><li>$f$ is not a bijection.</li></ol></li></ol>

<ol>
<li>Give an example of a bijection $h: \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0} \to \mathbb{N}_{\geq0}$. Note the domain and the codomain are different, and explain why the map $h(x) = x$ is not a bijection.</li>
<li>Consider the function $f\colon \mathbb{N}_{\geq 0} \to \mathbb{Z}$ where

</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-7-4-or-6">Choice Exercise 7 [4 or 6]</h3>
<p><em>Do at most one of the following programming problems. Be clear about which one you're attempting.</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>(This is the more inviting of the two programming problems.)<ol>
    <li>Write a function <code>f</code> which takes in a nonnegative integer and outputs an integer such that no two inputs have the same output <i>and</i> for every integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ there exists some nonnegative integer input <code>k</code> so that <code>f(k)==n</code>.</li>
    <li>Write a loop that prints out <code>f(0) = ?</code>, <code>f(1) = ?</code>, ..., <code>f(10) = ?</code>, but where <code>?</code> is the actual output of your function.</li>
    <li>Now let $g\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{> 0}$ be the bijection we described in class where we read the rational numbers by "antidiagonals." There's not really a good formula for this function, but that's ok, you don't need to define the function in code! Write a loop that prints <code>g(0) = 1/1</code>, <code>g(1) = 1/2</code>, <code>g(2) = 2/1</code>, <code>g(3) = 1/3</code>, <code>g(4) = 3/1</code>, and so on. Print out all of the values from $g(0)$ up to $g(10)$, and make sure that your output matches the beginning terms I gave you.</li>
    <li>Now let $g'\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}_{> 0}$ be a different bijection which you define. Write a loop that prints <code>g'(0) = 1/1</code>, <code>g'(1) = 1/2</code>, <code>g'(2) = 2/1</code>, <code>g'(3) = 1/3</code>, <code>g'(4) = 3/1</code>, and so on. Print out all of the values from $g'(0)$ up to $g'(10)$, and make sure to include all your code!</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>(This is the more difficult of the two programming problems.)<ol>
    <li>[1] Write a program that defines (in principle) a bijective function $f\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$. "Prove by example" that it works by printing <code>f(n)</code> for $n = 0, 1, \dots 10$, and paste your output here in an appropriate environment such as <code>verbatim</code>.</li>
    <li>[1] Write a program that defines the inverse function $g\colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}$. Paste your output of the following:<ol>
      <li>Print <code>g(n)</code> for $n = -5, -4, \dots, 4, 5$.</li>
      <li>Print <code>f(g(n))</code> for $n = -5, -4, \dots, 4, 5$.</li>
      <li>Print <code>g(f(n))</code> for $n = 0, 1, \dots, 9, 10$.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>[1] Write a bijective function $h\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ such that <code>h(0) = (0,0)</code>. Print <code>h(n)</code> for $n = 0, 1, \dots, 9, 10$.</li>
    <li>[1] Suppose you have two countably infinite sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ and corresponding bijections $f_1\colon \mathbb{N} \to A_1$ and $f_2\colon \mathbb{N} \to A_2$. Write a bijective function $f'\colon \mathbb{N} \to A_1 \times A_2$. Let $f_1$ be <code>f</code> and $f_2$ be <code>h</code>. Print <code>f'(n)</code> for $n = 0, 1, \dots, 9, 10.$</li>
    <li>[2] Can you get meta and use this to define a bijective function $b_k\colon\mathbb{N} \to \underbrace{\mathbb{N} \times \dots \times \mathbb{N}}_{k\ \text{copies}}$?</li>
  </ol></li>

    When I asked folks to send me a message about "Farey sequences" in class, I was actually thinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calkin%E2%80%93Wilf_tree">Calkin–Wilf tree</a>. <ol>
      <li>Read the Wikipedia article that I linked to above for a few minutes. In the article, it describes a bijection (a "breadth-first search" of the tree) from the natural numbers to the positive rational numbers: $$0 \mapsto \frac{1}{1},\quad 1 \mapsto \frac{1}{2},\quad 2 \mapsto \frac{2}{1},\quad 3 \mapsto \frac{1}{3},\quad 4 \mapsto \frac{3}{2},\quad \dots.$$ Describe the next five terms in this sequence.</li>
      <li>Can you prove that $8/11$ is in the tree? If so, what's the path down the tree to get there? (You'll start at $1/1$, and then go to $2/1$, and then to $2/3$, and then...)</li>

<h3 id="choice-exercise-9-5-5">Choice Exercise 9 [5 + 5]</h3>
<p><em>Do any of the following parts.</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>[5]
    Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of <i>algebraic numbers</i>, which are complex numbers that are the roots of polynomials, that is, they satisfy
    $$a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 = 0$$
    for some choice of $n \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ and $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Prove that there exists a surjection $f\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{A}$.<br>
    <i>(You are welcome to assume the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every degree-$n$ polynomial has at most $n$ roots.)</i>
  </li>
  <li>[5]
  Is there an infinity that is bigger than the cardinality of the reals? The answer is yes! Let $X$ be a set, and let $\mathcal{P}(X)$ be its <i>power set</i> which is a set containing all subsets of $X$.<ol>
    <li>  Read this (short) section on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument#General_sets">Cantor's diagonal argument for general sets</a> on Wikipedia. Rewrite it in your own words in such a way that you're convinced that it's true.</li>
    <li>Prove by induction that there are (at least) a countably infinite number of distinct infinities.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">continuum hypothesis</a> claims that "there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers." It turns out that this question is <i>independent</i> of the standard set of axioms, which means that you can't prove or disprove it using the ordinary rules of mathematics. Write a sentence telling me what you think of this!</li>
