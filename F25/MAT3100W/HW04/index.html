<h3 id="required-exercise-4-4">Required Exercise 4 [4]</h3>
<p>In class on Wednesday, week 5, we started to learn some set theory. We ended just before we got to talk about universal sets and De Morgan's law, so we'll do it here.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> Given some &quot;universal set&quot; $\mathcal{U}$ (usually implicit) and a set $A \subseteq \mathcal{U}$, the <em>complement</em> of $A$ (in $\mathcal U$) is $$A^c = \mathcal{U} \setminus A.$$</p>
<p>It's often clear what $\mathcal{U}$ is from the context, but sometimes it is explicitly specified.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Solve the following three questions about set complements.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Suppose that $\mathcal{O}$ is the set of odd integers. If $\mathcal{U} = \mathbb{Z}$ (the set of integers), what is $\mathcal{O}^c$?</li>
    <li>Suppose that $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 8\\}$ and the universal set is $\mathcal{U} = \{1, 2, \dots, 10\}$. What is $A^c$?</li>
    <li>Suppose that $B = \\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mid x^2 + y^2 > 1 \\}$ and $\mathcal{U} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. What is $B^c$? (You can describe this either geometrically or in set builder notation.)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Now prove De Morgan's laws. In both cases, assume that $A$ and $B$ are both subsets of the universal set $\mathcal{U}$.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>$(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$.</li>
    <li>$(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p><em>(To prove that two sets are equal, show that everything in the first set is in the second set <strong>and</strong> prove that everything in the second set is in the first set.)</em></p>
<h2 id="choice-exercises">Choice Exercises.</h2>
<p><em>Do 10 points worth of the following choice exercises. Make sure to tag the appropriate problems when you submit on Gradescope.</em></p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-5-2">Choice Exercise 5 [2]</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prove that if $3 \nmid n$ then $3 \mid (n^2 - 1)$.</li>
<li>Suppose it is 3:21 AM. What time will it be in 919 minutes? (Do this without using a calculator.)</li>
<li>What day of the week were you born on? What day of the week will it be on your 40th birthday? Compute this without using a calculator, but confirm that you got the right answer by looking at a calendar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>
<br>
<em>(Note: there are 10 leap days every 40 years, so your 40th birthday is $365 \times 40 + 10$ days after your date of birth.)</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-6-1-1-1">Choice Exercise 6 [1+1+1]</h3>
<p><em>Do any subset of the following for one point each.</em></p>
<p>Probably the reason that we use a decimal (base-$10$) system is because we have $10$ fingers. You could imagine an alternative world where people have $12$ fingers, and we use a base-$12$ system, whose &quot;digits&quot; would be $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B\}$, where $A = 10$ and $B = 11$.
<br>
When talking about base-$12$ representations, we often write the number with a subscript $12$. If we write a number with digits $a_k, a_{k-1}, \dots, a_1, a_0$ in base-$12$, then this number is equal to $$a_k12^k + a_{k-1}12^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 12^1 + a_0 12^0.$$ For example, $$
50B_{12} = 5(12^2) + 0(12^1) + 11(12^0) = 731.
$$</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's start with practicing base conversions. (Prove all of the following.)
<ul>
<li>What is $A0B7_{12}$ in decimal?</li>
<li>What is $123_{12} + 1_{12}$ in base-$12$? (You can do this problem without converting to decimal.)</li>
<li>What is $BBB_{12} + 1_{12}$ in base-$12$? (You can also do this problem without converting to decimal.)</li>
<li>How do you write $726$ in base-$12$?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is a divisibility trick that students would be taught in a base-$12$ world?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> (Prove any divisibility tricks that you claim.)</li>
<li>In computer programming, we often represent &quot;bytes&quot; in base-$16$ or &quot;hexadecimal.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> The &quot;digits&quot; are $$\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F\},$$ where $F_{16} = 15$.
<ul>
<li>What is the decimal value of $FF_{16}$, which is the biggest byte?</li>
<li>How do you write $143$ in hexadecimal?</li>
<li>Compute $10000 - 1$ in decimal (easy).</li>
<li>Compute $10000_{16} - 1_{16}$ and write the answer in hexadecimal.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><em>Self-assess your programming skills on a scale of $1$ to $10$, and call this rating $r$. This problem is worth up to $11 - r$ points. Start a timer for $6(11 - r)$ minutes, and stop when the timer goes off or you complete the problem. You get a point every six minutes you work on this problem. If you have no idea of where to start, I would <em>love</em> to work on this with you during office hours!</em></p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming">story from 2007</a> about people who apply to be computer programmers but don't have any coding experience. As a screening measure, an interviewer asked candidates during their interview to write a computer program based on a children's counting game from the UK: &quot;fizz buzz&quot;.</p>
<p>The game (and program) works like this:
Count from 1 to 100. Every time you encounter a number divisible by $3$, instead of saying the number, say &quot;fizz&quot;.
Every time you encounter a number divisible by $5$, instead of saying the number, say &quot;buzz&quot;.
Every time you encounter a number divisible by both $3$ and $5$, instead of saying the number, say &quot;fizz buzz&quot;.</p>
<p>For this exercise, choose a programming language that you don't know how to write &quot;fizz buzz&quot; in. If you have not done any (or much) programming before, I'd encourage you to use Python.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>If you use Python, here are a few tips to know:

<li>You don't have to install Python: you can run it on the web using a site like <a href="https://www.online-python.com/">online-python.com</a>.</li>
<li>To print a number like $726$, type <code>print(726)</code>.</li>
<li>To print a string like &quot;MAT3100W&quot;, type <code>print(&quot;MAT3100W&quot;)</code>.</li>
<li>To <em>loop</em> through (and print) the numbers from 0 to 15, type</li>

<p><em>Do any subset of the following parts.</em></p>
<p>In class we solved the equation (in modular arithmetic) of $$5x + 7 \equiv 11 \pmod{29},$$ and we did so by guessing the &quot;multiplicative inverse&quot; of $15$ in the integers mod $29$ (i.e. $15 \times 2 \equiv 1 \pmod{29}$) which we used to determine the multiplicative inverse of $5$ (i.e. $5 \times 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{29}$), which we then used to solve the equation.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: how can we determine the multiplicative inverses to solve linear equations in modular arithmetic without guessing?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[1]</strong> Explain why there is no integer $x$ such that $2x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Find the multiplicative inverses of $1, 2, \dots, 6$ in the integers mod $7$.</li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Look up how to do the Euclidean algorithm to compute greatest common divisors (GCD), or watch the video &quot;The Euclidean Algorithm: How and Why, Visually&quot; (13:28) by the YouTube channel Proof of Concept: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jwf6ncRmhPg?si=8W3N6kQKKS2eLwlA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></li>
<li><strong>[2]</strong> Do the Euclidean algorithm to determine the $\gcd(726,919)$.</li>
<li><strong>[3]</strong> If the greatest common divisor $\gcd(n,m)$ $1$, we call the numbers &quot;coprime,&quot; and we can unwind the Euclidean algorithm to determine the multiplicative inverse of $n$ in the integers mod $m$. (Which is equal to the multiplicative inverse of $m$ in the integers mod $n$!) Read the textbook, watch a YouTube video, or come to office hours to learn why. Then write up an explainer of how to find the multiplicative inverse, and use this to find an integer $x$ such that $$726x + 143 \equiv 214 \pmod{919}.$$</li>

<p>We can factor quadratic polynomials by &quot;completing the square&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea is that if we want to find the roots of a quadratic equation like $2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$, we can</p>
<ul>
<li>divide by the leading coefficient to get $x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x + 3 = 0$,</li>
<li>then subtract off the constant part to get $x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x = -3$,</li>
<li>then add $\frac{25}{16}$ to both sides to get $$
\underbrace{\left(x - \frac{5}{4}\right)^2}_{x^2 - \frac{5}{2}x + \frac{25}{16}}=-3 + \frac{25}{16} = -\frac{23}{16}.
$$</li>
<li>Now we can solve for $x$: $$\begin{align*} x - \frac{5}{4} &amp;= \pm \sqrt{-\frac{23}{16}} \\ x &amp;= \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{-23}}{4}. \end{align*}$$</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The roots of $x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 3$ are $p, q,$ and $r.$ What is the value of

<p>This problem came up in MAT 4111A, and a clever &quot;hack&quot; solution to the problem using modular arithmetic was presented too. This problem will guide you through that hack:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, $x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 3 = (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)$, so what is the value of $pqr$?</li>
<li>Second, expand $(p^2 + 4)(q^2 + 4)(r^2 + 4)$. Using the first part, compute $$(p^2 + 4)(q^2 + 4)(r^2 + 4) \pmod 4.$$ Which of the answer options are congruent to this value, modulo $4$?</li>
