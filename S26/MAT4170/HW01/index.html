<h3 id="exercise-3-6">Exercise 3 [6]</h3>

<p>
  Suppose that you have two (indistinguishable) coins with the following symmetries: you can flip over the left coin, the right coin, both, or neither, <em>and</em> you can swap their places.
  Some examples of the states of these coins are
  <span style="color:red;">H</span><span style="color:blue;">T</span>,
  <span style="color:red;">T</span><span style="color:blue;">T</span>,
  <span style="color:blue;">H</span><span style="color:red;">T</span>
  and so on.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    How many different states can the coins be in?
    How many symmetries are there? (These are equal!)
  </li>

  <li>
    Draw a Cayley diagram for this group of symmetries. Start by choosing a symmetry and apply it until you get back to where you started. Have you hit all of the possible states?
    <br>
    If not, choose a new symmetry (and a new color arrow) and apply it to all of the existing states (and apply the previous symmetry to all of your new states). Now have you hit all of the possible states? If not, rinse and repeat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Redraw the diagram to make it as symmetric as you can.
    Take a picture or screenshot of this, put it in the same folder as your <code>.tex</code> file, and embed it in the LaTeX with the command <code>\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{path/to/image_file.png}</code>.
    <br>
    <i>(Note, you will need to save the file as a JPEG or PNG. If you don't know how to do this, ask on Discord.)</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Each color of arrow in the diagram corresponds to what we call a <em>generator</em>.
    How many generators did you use?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is this group commutative?
    (i.e. does \(x * y = y * x\) for all \(x\) and \(y\)?)
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>
    Describe in words how you would explain to an eight year old what the notation \(\pi = 152634\) means.
  </li>

  <li>
    What word do we get by composing \(\pi \circ \pi\),
    where $\circ$ means "after"? (i.e. We are reading right-to-left.)
  </li>

  <li>
    What word do we get by composing \((\pi \circ \pi) \circ \pi\)?
  </li>

  <li>
    The <em>order</em> of an element is the smallest positive number of times we have to apply it to get back to the identity. (i.e. the least positive integer $k$ such that $\pi^k = \mathrm{id}$.)
    <br>
    What is the order of \(\pi\)?
  </li>

  <li>
    What is the <em>right inverse</em> of \(\pi\)?

<h3 id="exercise-5-1">Exercise 5 [1]</h3>
<p>
  We use lots of symbols to describe the "binary operation" for group elements depending on the context: $\star$, $*$, $\circ$, $+$, $\times$, juxtaposition<a id="ref-1" href="#label-1"><sup>1</sup></a>&mdash;you name it! These symbols have different meanings depending on the context.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Our first example of a binary operation was $*$, which we read as "followed by." If $h$ is a horizontal reflection (i.e. over the $y$-axis) and $r$ is a $120^\circ$ rotation in the positive (counterclockwise) direction. Write in words what symmetry $r * h$ describes.</li>
  <li>Just as easily, we could define a binary operation such as $\star$, and declare that our symbol means "after." In this case, we would read the symmetries "right-to-left." Write in words what symmetry $r \star h$ describes.</li>
  <li>When $f$ and $g$ are functions, then <i>function composition</i> gives us a way to combine two functions to get a new function. We denote this function as $f \circ g$. Does $\circ$ behave like "followed by" or does it behave like "after"?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="choice-exercises">Choice Exercises</h2>
<p><i>Do 10 points of the following.</i></p>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-6-4">Choice Exercise 6 [≤4]</h3>
<i>Choose any subset of the following parts (that you don't already know how to do) for 0.5 points each, except for the last one which is worth a full point.</i>
<p>When you're learning LaTeX, resources like Google, our class Discord, Detexify, and LLMs can all be very helpful. Here are some things that are good to know:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Write math in a sentence using <i>inline math mode</i>, by typing using <code>\(...\)</code> or <code>$...$</code>. Try <pre><code>\(f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4\)</code></pre>
    Write math in a sentence using <i>display-style math mode</i>, by typing using <code>\[...\]</code>. Try <pre><code>\[f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4\]</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Write text in <i>italics</i>, <b>bold</b> and <u>underline</u> with
    <ul>
      <li><code>\textit{...}</code></li>
      <li><code>\textbf{...}</code></li>
      <li><code>\underline{...}</code></li>
    </ul>
    Note that this does <i>not</i> work in math mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a sentence that includes inline math with both a subscript and superscript. For example you can write, "There exists \(g_{10}, g_2 \in G\) such that \(g_{10}^3 = g_2\)"  by typing <code>There exists &bsol;(g_{10}, g_2 &bsol;in G&bsol;) such that &bsol;(g_{10}^3 = g_2&bsol;)</code>. What happens if you type <code>g_10</code> instead of <code>g_{10}</code>?
  </li>
  <li>
    You can make ordered and unordered lists with the <code>enumerate</code> and <code>itemize</code> environments. Try it out: <pre><code>\begin{enumerate}
  \item ...
  \item ...
\end{enumerate}</code></pre>
    Do it again but with <code>itemize</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a proof environment with <code>\begin{proof} ... \end{proof}</code> and prove that for every integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ there exists an integer $b$ such that $a + b = 0$ (or anything else you want to prove).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to make a fraction or square root, you can do that with <code>\frac{3}{1+x}</code> or <code>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can type \(\mathbb{Z}\) as <code>\mathbb{Z}</code>, but that's annoying to type all the time, right? Instead near the top of your file, define your own command: <code>\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The best way to do line breaks in your writing is by just leaving a blank space. Try it!<pre><code>A sentence from one paragraph.

A sentence from the next paragraph.</code></pre>
    While <code>\\</code>  will create a line break, it's usually a typographical best practice to only use it in math mode (like in the matrix code below.)
  </li>
  <li>[1]
    Make sure you have <code>\usepackage{amsmath}</code> at the top of your file, and then modify the following syntax to make a $3 \times 4$ matrix:
    <pre><code>\[
  \left(
  \begin{bmatrix}{ccc}
    $a_{11}$ & $a_{12}$ & $a_{13}$ \\
    $a_{21}$ & $a_{22}$ & $a_{23}$
  \end{bmatrix}
  \right)
\]</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="choice-exercise-7-3">Choice Exercise 7 [3]</h3>
<p>
  Fill in all 36 cells of the Cayley table for the symmetric group on three elements, $S_3$. Make sure to replace <code>(13)(12)</code> with the corresponding element of $S_3$ in cycle notation.
</p>
<p>
  Here we are thinking of the elements of $S_3$ as a "left action," so we read the elements from right to left.
</p>
<p>
  We use the convention that the row element is on the left and the column element is on the right, as shown in the filled-in cell, and recall that we use the convention of evaluating the cycles right-to-left because we think of them as function applications.

  One way of proving that a group is commutative is by proving that its <i>generators</i> are commutative. That is, if you can draw the Cayley diagram with two colors of arrows representing $g_1$ and $g_2$ AND $g_1 * g_2 = g_2 * g_1$, then $x * y = y * x$.
