  <summary>Choice Exercise 5 [3 + 4]</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We have already seen groups with infinitely many elements. One such example is the integers under addition: $(\mathbb{Z},+)$. We're going to make two different (infinite) Cayley diagrams, where one is nice and the other is... less nice. You are encouraged to hand-draw these diagrams and upload a picture or screenshot, but you can also try to make a computer graphic if you want.
      <ol>
        <li>
          The integers under addition can be generated by $1$, meaning that we can get to any number with repeated applications of $+1$ or its inverse, $+(-1)$. Draw a Cayley diagram for $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ using just $1$ as a generator. Figure out how to illustrate this since you can't draw all $\infty$ edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can also generate $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ with $2$ and $3$, which means we can get any integer by repeated applications of $2$, $3$, and their inverses $-2$ and $-3$. How can you write $-1$ as sums of these generators and their inverses? How can you write $7$ this way?
        </li>
        <li>
          Draw a Cayley diagram for $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ using the generators $2$ and $3$ for your arrows. Can you make it look nice at all?
        </li>
      </ol>

      Draw two Cayley diagrams for $S_3$, and one for $D_3$, and use <code>\includegraphics</code> to include a picture of each.

  <summary>Choice Exercise 7 [3]</summary>
  <p>Students showed interest in learning how to draw a Cayley diagram with TikZ. In this exercise, I'm going to walk you through how to draw $D_6$.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make sure that you have <code>\usepackage{tikz}</code> at the top. We write our TikZ code in the <code>tikzpicture</code> environment:
      <pre><code>\begin{tikzpicture}
  [...]
\end{tikzpicture}</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Start by drawing a node or two. (We can do a small amount of computation by wrapping things in <code>{...}</code>, but it's kind of fussy.)
      <pre><code>\node[draw, circle] (id) at (2,0) {};</code></pre>
      Here <code>[draw, circle]</code> tells us to shape our node like a circle and draw its boundary; <code>(id)</code> specifies the name of the node; we're positioning it at <code>(2,0)</code>; and <code>{}</code> tells us what to write in there (nothing). (We could also compute the coordinates like <code>({2*cos(0)}, {2*sin(0)})</code>.)
      <br>
      Put five nodes evenly spaced around the circle of radius two named, <code>id</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>r2</code>, ..., <code>r5</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now we can connect these up with edges: <pre><code>\draw[blue, thick, ->] (id)--(r);</code></pre> This tells TikZ to draw a blue thick arrow pointing from the node named <code>id</code> to the node named <code>r</code>. Draw six blue $r$ edges. (At this point, you have drawn the Cayley diagram for the cyclic group $C_6$, which is a <em>subgroup</em> of $D_6$.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Now add six more nodes, which I recommend you name
      <code>(f)</code>,
      <code>(rf)</code>,
      <code>(r2f)</code>,
      ...
      <code>(r5f)</code>.
      Connect these together with six more blue $r$ edges, and pay close attention to which direction the arrows go.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make some red $f$ edges to connect the inner and outer hexagons. If you want a bidirectional arrow you can do <code>&lt;-&gt;</code> instead of <code>-&gt;</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Choice Exercise 9 [≤7]</summary>
  <i>This week's programming exercise. You can do any subset of the following, and you get one point per ten minutes spent on this problem, up to 7.</i>
  <p>
      In class, we saw that there exists an element in $S_{10}$ of order $30$. In this exercise you will write a program that computes things related to the order of elements of the symmetric group. Start a timer before you begin this problem.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Write a function that takes in a positive integer <code>n</code> and outputs a list of all of the possible orders of elements in $S_n$. For example, <code>f(10)</code> should output <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 30]</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write a script that outputs <code>max(f(n))</code> for $1 \leq n \leq 20$, and another script that outputs <code>length(f(n))</code> for $1 \leq n \leq 20$.
    </li>
    <li>
      How many of the $8! = 40320$ elements of $S_{8}$ have order $15$? How many have order $16$?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many of the more than 121 quadrillion elements in $S_{19}$ have order $210$? (This is too big to check the order of each one. See if you can find a trick to determine the answer to this question.)

  <summary>Choice Exercise 10 [3]</summary>
  <p>
    In computer programming, a common data type is a <code>string</code>, which is broadly used to represent text, and consists of letters, punctuation, emojis, etc.
    Some programming languages let you concatenate two strings together with the <code>+</code> operation, so for example, <code>"hello" + "world" = "helloworld"</code>, similarly <code>"hello" + "" = "hello"</code>.
    The set of strings under the concatenation operation forms what's called a "monoid," but it does not form a group.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Why doesn't the set of strings under concatenation form a group?</li>
    <li>Suppose that we add a new "backspace" character that we'll denote <code>\b</code>, which deletes the character before it so that
    <code>"hello" + "\bworld" = "hellworld"</code>.
    If there is no character before it, it does nothing:
    <code>"\b" + "hello" = "hello"</code>.
    Does this form a group? Which axioms does it satisfy, and which does it fail to satisfy?</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Choice Exercise 11 [5]</summary>
  <p>
    In 2024, I asked ChatGPT for some interesting near-miss examples of finite groups, which have some of the properties of a group but not others. It gave me six examples, most of which were on the right track, but five of the six were... <i>strange</i> in some way. For each ChatGPT-generated example, spot (a) the error, (b) the poor mathematical writing, <i>or</i> (c) the strange choice.
    (You can choose any subset of the following for one point each.)
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Set</b>: $\{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ under multiplication modulo $n$.
      <br>
      <b>Why it fails</b>: In this structure, there is no guarantee of inverses. For example, in $\{1,2,3,4\}$ under multiplication modulo $8$, $2$ and $4$ do not have multiplicative inverses. Thus, it is a semigroup (associative but lacks inverses).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Set</b>: Take $\{1, 2, 3\}$ with a non-associative binary operation like:
      \begin{align*}
        1 \cdot 1 &= 1 \\
        1 \cdot 2 &= 2, \quad 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \\
        2 \cdot 2 &= 1
      \end{align*}
      but $\ (1 \cdot 2) \cdot 2 \neq 1 \cdot (2 \cdot 2)$.
      <br>
      <b>Why it fails</b>: This structure fails the associativity property. It's a loop since every element has a unique inverse, but the binary operation isn't associative.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Set</b>: $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ under addition modulo $4$.
      <br>
      <b>Why it fails</b>: While this structure is a group under addition, if you use <i>multiplication</i> modulo 4, the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$ does not form a group because $2$ and $3$ do not have multiplicative inverses modulo $4$.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Set</b>: $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ under addition modulo $4$.
      <br>
      <b>Why it fails</b>: This set forms a <i>monoid</i> because it has an identity element (0) and the operation is associative, but some elements, like 2 and 3, do not have inverses under addition modulo 4.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Set</b>: $\{(1), (12), (13)\}$, a subset of the symmetric group $S_3$, with composition as the operation.
      <br>
      <b>Why it fails</b>: This set is closed under the operation and associative but lacks inverses for every element. For example, in this subset, (12) and (13) do not have inverses in the subset. Hence, it's a semigroup but not a group.
