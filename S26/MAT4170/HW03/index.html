  <ol>
    <li>[2]
      Certain mattress manufacturers recommend flipping a mattress every 6 months to prevent uneven wear, alternating between each of its four symmetries.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prove that the "mattress flipping" group cannot be generated by a single element, which means that you cannot do the same procedure each six months if you want even wear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain why flipping the mattress over each spring and rotating it $180^\circ$ each fall will hit each of the four symmetries equally.

    <li>[2]
      Prove that if $G$ a group with a subgroup $H \leq G$. Then if $h \in H$ and $g \in G \setminus H$ (i.e. $g$ is in $G$ but not in $H$) then $g * h \notin H$.
    </li>
    <li>[2]
      Explain why the inverse of the permutation $(12345)(6)(789)$ is $(987)(6)(54321)$. And use this principle find the inverse of $\pi = (726314)(95)$ in cycle notation.

      There are two elements in $D_4$ that commute with every other element. In other words, there exist two distinct elements $g_1$ and $g_2$ such that $a * g_1 = g_1 * a$ and $a * g_2 = g_2 * a$ for all $a \in D_4$. Find them.

    <span style="font-size: small;">(proofs)</span>
  </summary>
  <ol>
    <li>[2]
      Replace each instance of $\sim$ in the proof environment in order to fill in a proof of the following theorem. (Recall you can copy/paste the math on the website ot get LaTeX.)
      <p>
        <b>Theorem.</b> If $(G,\star)$ is a finite group, and $g \in G$, then the order of $g$ is finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Proof.</b> Recall the definition of the order of an element: ~ ~ ~ ~ ~.
        <br>
        Suppose that $|G| = n$. Now consider the sequence of elements $(g^1, g^2, g^3, \dots, g^{n+1})$. There must exist some $g^k$, $g^m$ (with $k &lt; m$) such that $g^k = g^m$ because ~ ~ ~ ~ ~.
        <br>
        Thus, we can multiply both sides by $~ ~$ \begin{align*}
          g^k &= g^m \\
          g^k \star (~) &= g^m \star (~) \\
          (~~) &= (~~) \\
        \end{align*}
        <br>
        Therefore $g^{~} = e \in G$, so ~ ~ ~ ~.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>[4]
      Let $a \in (G,*)$ and recall that we define $\langle a \rangle$ as $\langle a \rangle = \{a^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Recall that we define \[
        a^n = \underbrace{a * a * \dots * a}_{n \text{ times}} \qquad \text{and} \qquad a^{-n} = \underbrace{a^{-1} * a^{-1} * \dots * a^{-1}}_{n \text{ times}}.
      \]
      We will prove that $a^k * a^m = a^{k + m}$ for all $k, m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
      <ol>
        <li>Start by explaining why if $k \geq 0$ and $m \geq 0$, then $a^k * a^m = a^{k + m}$.</li>
        <li>Explain why an essentially similar argument shows that if $k \leq 0$ and $m \leq 0$, then $a^k * a^m = a^{k + m}$.</li>
        <li>
          Now, let $n = -k$.
          <ol>
            <li>Show that if $m > k$ then $a^m * (a^{-1})^k = a^{m+n}$.</li>
            <li>Show that if $m = k$ then $a^m * (a^{-1})^k = a^{m+n}$.</li>
            <li>Show that if $m < k$ then $a^m * (a^{-1})^k = a^{m+n}$.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>State why the above is done "without loss of generality" with respect to the negative exponent being on the right. In other words, write a sentence stating why the proofs where the inverses are on the left are essentially the same.</li>
        <li>An abelian group is a group where $g_1 * g_2 = g_2 * g_1$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$. Use the identity $a^k * a^m = a^{k + m}$ to prove that $\langle a \rangle$ is an abelian group.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>[2]
      Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $a \in G$. Let $H$ be the set of elements that commutes with $a$: \[
        H = \{ g \in G \mid g * a = a * g \}.
      \] Prove or disprove whether $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. (Sometimes $H$ is denoted $C_G(\{a\})$.)
    </li>
    <li>[1]
      Prove or disprove. If $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices, and $AB = A$, then $B$ is the identity matrix, $B = I_n$.

    <li>[4]
      Prove that the set of matrices that have one $\pm 1$ per row and column forms a group under matrix multiplication. This group is called the octahedral group, sometimes written $B_3$. Without looking it up, determine the order of this group.
    </li>
    <li>[2]
      Download OpenSCAD, write a <code>module</code> named <code>blob</code> that makes something asymmetrical. You can use any tools that you would like to learn how to do this, but just say which tools you used. Here's my blob, which I display by typing it below the module definition.

      Apply all possible matrices from part 1 to this using <code>multmatrix(...)</code>. (You probably want to write a program that prints OpenSCAD code instead of doing this by hand.)

  [0, -1, 0],
  [0,  0, 1],
  [1,  0, 0]

      Do this again, but color the parts whose corresponding matrix has determinant $1$ different from the color of those whose corresponding matrix has determinant $-1$.
