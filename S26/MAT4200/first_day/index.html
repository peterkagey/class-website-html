<i>Drawing with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)</i>

We're going to start with the following SVG code (you can scroll right to see the whole thing):

<pre><code>&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; viewbox=&quot;0 0 100 100&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
  &lt;rect x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;path d=&quot;M 20 90 L 80 40 L 20 50 L 20 20&quot; stroke=&quot;white&quot; stroke-width=&quot;2px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code></pre>

Here's how we understand it: <ul>
  <li>The first line (beginning <code>&lt;svg xmlns...</code>) is just telling the SVG parser that we're talking about an SVG file.</li>
  <li>The <code>width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;</code> variables tell your browser to display it as 300px × 300px.</li>
  <li>The <code>viewbox=&quot;0 0 100 100&quot;</code> tells us that we're dealing with coordinates between 0 and 100 for both the $x$ and $y$ axis. (Mathematically, this means we're drawing in the square $[0,100] \times [0,100] \subsetneq \mathbb{R}^2$)</li>
  <li>The code <code>fill=&quot;none&quot;</code> sets a default telling the parser not to fill in the shapes and only draw the outlines.</li>
  <li>The line beginning <code>&lt;rect ...</code> draws a black background starting at $(0,0)$ in the <i>upper</i> and ending at $(100,100)$ in the <i>lower</i> right. (Note that the $y$ coordinate is flipped!)</li>
  <li>
    The next line (which begins <code>&lt;path d=</code>) is where the magic happens. The <code>d</code> stands for data, and describes how to draw the path.<ul>
      <li>
        Inside of the string, <code>M</code> stands for <b>M</b>ove, so the code <code>M 20 90</code> says to move to the position $(20,90)$. (Remember, the $y$-coordinate points <i>down</i>!)
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>L</code> stands for <b>L</b>ine, so the code <code>L 80 40</code> says to draw a line from the previous position $(20, 90)$ to the specified position $(80, 40)$.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the <code>path</code> line, <code>stroke=&quot;white&quot; stroke-width=&quot;2px&quot;</code> specifies the color and thickness of the line.</li>
  <li>The final <code>&lt;/svg&gt;</code> is a "closing tag" which just tells the parser that we're all done!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lets-draw">Let's draw!</h2>
<p>You'll hear me say this term that the best way to learn mathematics (and lots of other things) is to just play!</p>
<p>Start by changing some numbers and colors, and see what happens. As you change the code, the SVG image should automatically update.</p>

<textarea id="svgInput" style="width:100%; height:14em; resize: vertical;">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="300" height="300" viewbox="0 0 100 100" fill="none">
  <rect x="0" y="0" height="100" width="100" fill="black"></rect>
  <path d="M 20 90 L 80 40 L 20 50 L 20 20 M 40 60 L 10 90" stroke="white" stroke-width="2px"></path>
</svg>
</textarea>

<h2 id="the-coordinate-system">The coordinate system</h2>
<p>
  Recall that the coordinate system that SVG files use is "updside down" because it draws the pixels in reading order (left-to-right and top-to-bottom.) This means that the $x$-axis points to the right ➡️, and the $y$-axis points down ⬇️, which can take some getting used to! <i>(One unexpected consequence of this is that we measure angles clockwise instead of counterclockwise!)</i>
</p>

<p>
  Do the following activities with your group, and reach out if you get stuck!
  </p><ol>
    <li>
      Drawing with lines
      <ol>
        <li>
          On a piece of paper or tablet or whiteboard, create a logo which consists of three to six lines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try reproduce it as an SVG as accurately as possible. (If you have multiple colors, you can draw multiple <code>path</code> elements, you can also draw lines on top of each other with different thicknesses.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a picture of your drawing and a screenshot of the SVG and post them both to the <code>#in-class</code> Discord channel. (You can find the invitation to the Discord channel on our syllabus.)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Parameterizing lines
      <ol>
        <li>
          The standard way to parameterize a line from a point (vector) $\mathbf{v}_1$ to a point $\mathbf{v}_2$ is with the formula \[
            \boldsymbol{\ell}(t) = (1-t)\mathbf{v}_1 + t\mathbf{v}_2,
          \] for $t \in [0,1]$. Check the endpoints by evaluating at $t = 0$ and $t=1$ to see that this gives what you want.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix}-1\\4\end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix}3\\2\end{pmatrix}$, and write the parameterized curve in terms of its $x$- and $y$-coordinates: \[
            \boldsymbol{\ell}(t) = \begin{pmatrix}\square\\\square\end{pmatrix}.
          \] (That is, fill in the squares.)
        </li>
        <li>
          In WolframAlpha, you can plot this as <code>parametric plot (2t-1, 3t+2), t=0..1</code>. Use WolframAlpha or any other tool to plot this line (but first try to imagine how you think it will look!)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Drawing regular polygons.
      <ol>
        <li>Draw an equilateral triangle in any orientation that you want.</li>
        <li><i>Optional challenge: draw the biggest possible equilateral triangle that will fit in the square.</i></li>
        <li>Draw a square, but draw it crooked so that the edges of the square aren't horizontal/vertical.</li>
        <li>Can you draw a regular pentagon?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Drawing (Bézier) curves
      <ol>
        <li>The most important element after for drawing nice smooth figures are the <b>Q</b>uadratic and <b>C</b>ubic the Bézier curves.</li>
        <li>
          We'll start with the (simpler) quadratic bezier curve. In order to draw this we specify <code>Q x1 y1 x y</code>, where <code>x1 y1</code> is called a "control point" and <code>x y</code> is the endpoint. Append <code>Q 50 20 70 80</code> to the end of your code, wiggle the numbers, and see if you can figure out what's going on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here's something that might help you figure out what's going on: right now your <code>path</code> should end with <code>x' y' Q x1 y1 x y</code>. Write a new line beneath this which is <pre><code>&lt;path d=&quot;M x' y' L x1 y1 L x y&quot; stroke=&quot;red&quot; stroke-dasharray=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
          Does this help you see what the control point is doing?
          (If this doesn't look right, let me know, and we can debug it together.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Now do the same thing with a <b>C</b>ubic Bézier curve, which has <i>two</i> control points, so we specify <code>C x1 y1 x2 y2 x y</code>. Choose numbers for each of these variables, append this to your SVG code, and see if you can sort out what's going on.
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll do something analogous to what we did before:
          your <code>path</code> should end with <code>x' y' C x1 y1 x2 y2 x y</code>. Write a new line beneath this which is <pre><code>&lt;path d=&quot;M x' y' L x1 y1 L x2 y2 L x y&quot; stroke=&quot;green&quot; stroke-dasharray=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
          Does this help you see what the control points are doing?
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to connect two quadratic Bézier curves together so that the curve is "differentiable" (i.e. there's no "corner where they meet").
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to connect two cubic Bézier curves together so that the curve is "differentiable" (i.e. there's no "corner where they meet").
        </li>
        <li>Can you take your original line drawing "logo" and smooth out all of the corners by converting your lines to Bézier curves?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>(Bonus part)</i>
      Drawing with circles and circular arcs.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Drawing a circle is easy enough, just use code like <code>&lt;circle cx=&quot;50&quot; cy=&quot;22&quot; r=&quot;20&quot; stroke=&quot;red&quot;&gt;</code>. (Put this into your SVG code)
        </li>
        <li>
          What do <code>cx</code>, <code>cy</code>, and <code>r</code> do? You can probably guess, but play around to find out!
        </li>
        <li>
          Maybe though, you want to use circular <b>A</b>rcs to make the corners of your logo look smooth. We don't use the <code>circle</code> tag for that, instead we use the <code>A</code> command in a path. This command is kind of complicated: <pre><code>A rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y</code></pre>
          I'll explain what some of these things mean in a second, but start by putting <code>A 75 75 0 0 0 50 50</code> at the end of one of your <code>path</code> elements and see what happens.
        </li>
        <li>
          This <code>A</code> instruction draws elliptical arcs, so it has you specify both the $x$- and $y$-radii. Since we're just thinking about circles, we have the <code>rx</code> and <code>ry</code> values the same, which means that the <code>x-axis-rotation</code> doesn't do anything (since rotating a circle looks the same). The <code>large-arc-flag</code> and <code>sweep-flag></code> can be set to <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, and they just say which part of the circle to draw. Lastly the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> at the end specify where to stop drawing the arc. Play around with these values and see if you can draw something interesting.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
<p></p>
<h2 id="and-beyond">And beyond!</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
  Did you finish everything? If so, get more practice drawing with Bézier curves. See if you can write your name, draw a rainbow, approximate a circle with Bézier curves, etc.
</li>
<li>
  If you have experience programming (or even if you don't!) you can try to write a program that draws something more sophisticated with hundreds or thousands of lines, arcs, and Bézier curves.
</li>
<li>
  Look up how we parameterize a quadratic Bézier curve with starting point $\mathbf{v}_1$, control point $\mathbf{v}_2$, and endpoint $\mathbf{v}_3$. Can you prove that it has the properties that you think it does? How about a cubic Bézier curve?
