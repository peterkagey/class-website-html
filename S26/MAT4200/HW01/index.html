<p>
  This exercise is to help you get access to the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/makerstudio/index.shtml">SIIL</a> Maker Studio. <em>(I'm having you do this because laser cutters, 3D printers, embroidery machines, vinyl cutters, etc all run on <em>parametric curves</em>, and later on in the term, I want you to learn how to deploy ideas from differential geometry to use some of these machines.)</em>

<h2 id="choice-exercises">Choice Exercises</h2>
<p><i>Do 8 points of the following exercises.</i></p>
<h3 id="2-4-2-2-4-choice-exercise-4">[2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4] Choice Exercise 4</h3>
<i>Do any subset of the following, but for each part you pick, do the entire part.</i>
<p>
In these problems, we will think about how to embed a tetrahedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the previous homework you were instructed on finding the embedding with vertices at \[
  (0,0,0), \qquad (2,0,0), \qquad (1, \sqrt{3},0), \quad \text{and} \quad \Big(1,\frac{\sqrt{3}}3, \frac{2\sqrt{6}}3\Big).
\] My favorite embedding is perhaps the one with vertices at \[
  (1,1,-1), \quad (1,-1,1), \quad (-1,1,1), \quad (-1,-1,-1),
\] because it avoids square roots.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>[2]</b>
    A regular tetrahedron is the unique polyhedron (up to similarity) with four vertices with the property that the distance of each edge (between each pair of vertices is the same). In the polyhedron with vertices at \[
      (1,1,-1), \quad (1,-1,1), \quad (-1,1,1), \quad (-1,-1,-1),
    \] where each vertex is connected to every other via an edge, how many edges are there, and how can we see that they all have the same length?
  </li>
  <li><b>[4]</b>
    Choose any two non-intersecting edges. There is a unique plane that is equidistant between them. Find out where this plane intersects the other edges. What can you say about these points? (In addition to the four points, come swing by my office and I'll give you a gift of a 3D-printed puzzle that relates to this.)
  </li>
  <li><b>[2]</b>
    Starting with the tetrahedron with coordinates of $(1,1,-1)$, $(1,-1,1)$, $(-1,1,1)$, and $(-1,-1,-1)$, compute the position of the vertex that appears when we glue a tetrahedron to one of the faces, as illustrated in the rotatable model below.

    </div>
  </li>
  <li><b>[2]</b>
    Compute dihedral angle (angle between faces) of the tetrahedron. Why can't regular tetrahedra tile space? What's the angle of the gap in the following <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Quadaugmented_tetrahedron.png">quadaugmented_tetrahedron</a>, which you can click and drag below.

    </div>
  </li>

    Find explicit coordinates for the vertex coordinates of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Quadaugmented_tetrahedron.png">quadaugmented_tetrahedron</a> (which you can click and drag above), where the "central" tetrahedron has coordinates $(1,1,-1)$, $(1,-1,1)$, $(-1,1,1)$, and $(-1,-1,-1)$.

  Spend up to 40 more minutes working on Exercise 2 by doing more Maker Studio training, certification, or making. (If you make something, post a photo to the Discord!)

<i>You get a point for every 10 minutes you work on this exercise, up to 4 points.</i>

  <li>
    Start a timer, and read from one or more of the textbooks. You can also use this time to work through any problems that you see in the book.
  </li>
  <li>
    Post something short on the <code>#hw-prompts</code> Discord about what you learned or reminded yourself of, a gotcha you ran into, or anything else of interest.

I have a drawing robot called an AxiDraw V3 pen plotter, which is shown in the video below.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1gaCjqrVGI?si=GX1p-Bz0-u5lYYcV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<ol>
  <li>
      By hand or by writing a computer program<a id="ref-1" href="#label-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, write out an SVG file that you would like to have the robot draw. Recall that in our <a href="/S26/MAT4200/first_day/">first day SVG activity,</a> you could see the SVG upload live. Here's the code we used to get started.
    <pre><code>&lt;svg  xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; viewbox=&quot;0 0 100 100&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
&lt;rect x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;/&gt;
&lt;path d=&quot;M 20 90 L 80 40 L 20 50 L 20 20&quot; stroke=&quot;white&quot; stroke-width=&quot;2px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Post the SVG file on Discord (which will display it as code) and post a screenshot. Then tell me what color and size you want me to get my robot to draw it. (The robot can draw up to roughly US Letter or A4, and it only draws paths, not fills or text.) </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-choice-exercise-8">[3] Choice Exercise 8</h3>

  <li>
    Watch the YouTube video (24:25) "The Beauty of Bézier Curves" by Freya Holmér.

  </li>
  <li>
    Include a screenshot of a frame from the video that stood out to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a couple sentences about what you liked, didn't like, found interesting, found confusing, etc.

  <li>[≤2] Ask a question on Discord. (One point per question, up to 2.)</li>
  <li>[≤4] Answer a classmate's question on Discord or give a hint about a problem on this week's assignment.<a id="ref-asterisk" href="#label-asterisk"><sup>2</sup></a> (Two points per answer/hint, up to 4.)</li>
  <li>[≤4] Can you generalize any of the above problems in an interesting way? If so say what the generalization is, attempt to solve it, say something about it, and say how many points you feel like your effort was worth, up to 4.</li>
  <li>[≤4] Choose one or more problems from our textbook or a previous homework assignment which interest you and write the problem statement along with an answer. Say how many points you feel like your effort was worth, up to 4.</li>
  <li>[2] Stop by student drop-in hours.</li>
  <li>[2 or 5] Work on at least one of the above exercises with a classmate. State which classmate you worked with and which exercises you collaborated on.
