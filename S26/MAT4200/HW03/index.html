  </summary>
  <ol>
    <li>[3]
      During the Week 4 Monday warmup, we checked Green's Theorem by computing the integral of $\operatorname{curl}(\mathbf{F})$ for \[
        \mathbf{F}(x,y) = (y \cos(x), xy^2)
      \] over the region $R$ bounded between the parabola $y = 1/2 - x^2$ and the line $y = -1/2$.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Plot the vector field over the region in Mathematica with <pre><code>Show[
  VectorPlot[..., {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}],
  RegionPlot[... &lt;= y &lt;= ..., {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]
]</code></pre>
          where you fill in the <code>...</code> as appropriate. Include the image in your write-up. Should the integrals be positive or negative?
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up the integral $\iint_R \operatorname{curl}(\mathbf{F}) dA$ and compute it by hand or with a computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Swap the order of integration, adjusting the bounds of the integral, and re-compute the integral.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up the line integral $\oint_{\partial R} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}$ around the boundary of this region. Compute this integral by hand or with a computer.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>[3]
      In our week 4 Wednesday warmup, we computed \[
        \iint_D \operatorname{curl}(\mathbf{F})\, dA
      \] where $D$ was the unit square with opposite corners at $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, $\mathbf{F}(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix}y \\ -x\end{pmatrix}$. Now we will compute the vector line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ around the (positively oriented) boundary $\partial D$.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by drawing the vector field in Mathematica with <code>VectorPlot</code>. Figure out how to use this by looking at the documentation, which you can do by typing <code>VectorPlot</code>, right-clicking on the word, and selecting <code>Get Help</code>. (Mathematica is a very complicated language, but the documentation is quite good.) Include the plot in your write-up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, we need to chop up the boundary into four parts. Let  $\gamma_1$ be the curve from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$. How do you know that the integral along this part will evaluate to zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          Going around in this way, call the next side of the square $\gamma_2$, and then $\gamma_3$ and $\gamma_4$. Which other segment has zero contribution to the integral?
        </li>
        <li>
          We sometimes write these kinds of integrals as \[
            \int F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy.
          \] On the remaining two curves, which parts of the integrands evaluate to zero (because we're only changing one of $x$ or $y$)? How about on $\gamma_3$? What are the fixed values of $x$ or $y$ when you evaluate each of these integrals?
        </li>
        <li>
          Now set up these two integrals over their respective paths and add them together. Does it match what we got in the warmup?
        </li>
        <li>
          How does this relate to our warmup?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>[2]
      In class, we set up the integral \[
        \int_{x=-1}^1 \int_{y=0}^{\frac12 - x^2} \operatorname{curl}(\mathbf{F})\, dy\, dx.
      \]
      Integrate over the same region, but swap $dx$ and $dy$: \[
        \int_{y=\square}^\square \int_{x=\square}^\square \cdots\, dy\, dx.
      \]
    </li>
    <li>[3]
      In physics, we sometimes compute the mass of a $3$-dimensional region by taking a triple integral of its density. Suppose that we have an object which is the convex hull of the points $(1,2,1)$, $(1,2,0)$, $(2,1,1)$, and $(1,1,0)$, and the density is given by $F(x,y,z) = 13.1 + 0.2x^2 - 0.3xz + 0.1y$.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Get a sense of the region by wrapping <code>ConvexHullRegion[&#123;{1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 0}, {2, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 0}&#125;]</code> with <code>Graphics3D[...]</code>. Include this in your write-up.
        </li>
        <li>
          What are the possible range of $x$ values in this region? What are the possible range of $y$ values (describe these in terms of $x$). What are the possible $z$ values in terms of the two bounding planes?
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up the integral and compute it by hand or with a computer.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>[2]
      Wikipedia has a chart showing the density of the earth at various depths. Approximate this with a piecewise-defined function, consisting of at least two linear segments. Using spherical coordinates, estimate the mass of the earth. Then, paying close attention to units, look up the actual mass of the earth, and describe the relative error of your integral.

          We denote the hypervolume of an $n$-dimensional unit ball as $V_n$. Prove inductively that $V_n = \frac{2\pi}{n}V_{n-2}$ using the method described on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_an_n-ball#The_two-dimension_recursion_formula">Wikipedia</a>:

    Choice Exercise 5 [8]
    <span style="font-size: small;">(modeling)</span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    We can model the power generation of a flat solar panel in a constant solar radiation field as the dot product of two vectors: a vector $\vec{\alpha}$ which is orthogonal to the solar panel whose magnitude is the area of the solar panel, and a vector $\vec{r}$ which points in the direction of the light with a magnitude corresponding to the intensity of the light. We can use this to compute the power generation of curved surfaces in non-constant radiation fields by "chopping up" the surface and using calculus.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>[1]
      Suppose we have a $900$ watt point source at $(1,2,3)$, measured in meters. With the knowledge that light intensity drops off according to the "inverse squared law" where the intensity of the light is $900/d^2$ at a distance $d$ from the source, describe the function of light intensity at $(x,y,z)$, and specify the units.
    </li>
    <li>[1]
      Suppose that we have a cylindrical solar panel of radius $0.5$ around the line segment from $(-1,0,0)$ to $(1,0,0)$. Plot the solar panel and the point in Mathematica or another program.
    </li>
    <li>[2]
      Keeping in mind that some of the solar panel is in shadow, compute how much power the solar panel generates. You can use a tool to compute this numerically if you want. Putting something like <code>Max[0, F[x, y, z]]</code> in your integrand might help.
    </li>
    <li>[3]
      Let $\mathbf{S}\colon U \to \mathbb{R}^3$ (where $U \subset \mathbb{R}^2$) be your parameterization of the cylindrical solar panel. For which points in $U$ is the solar panel in the light versus the shadow? Is half of the cylinder in its shadow? More? Less?

      In what ways is this a good model? In what ways is this a poor model?

      Now is your turn to make some oscilloscope music. I'm going to guide you through how to do it in Mathematica, but (as always) you can use another programming language if you wish. Start by writing the code
      <pre><code>Play[Sin[440*2 Pi t], {t, 0, 2}]</code></pre>
      and play it. You should hear a perfect sine wave playing at 440Hz, which is defined as an ISO standard for A4 (the A above middle C).
    </li>
    <li>[1]
      Most digital audio we hear in our lives is played in stereo, where there are two speakers, and the right and left speaker can play different sounds. We'll use this to play a simple two note chord.
      <pre><code>
        LeftEar[t_] := Sin[330*2 Pi t]
        RightEar[t_] := Cos[440*2 Pi t]
        Play[{LeftEar[t], RightEar[t]}, {t, 0, 2}]
      </code></pre>
      Can you hear the difference?
    </li>
    <li>[1]
      Next, we're going to visualize what you would see on an oscilloscope. The <code>LeftEar</code> will move the light from left to right, and the <code>RightEar</code> will move it from bottom to top.
      <pre><code>
        ParametricPlot[{LeftEar[t], RightEar[t]}, {t, 0, 2}, PlotPoints -> 1000]
      </code></pre>
      (We have to put the <code>PlotPoints -> 1000</code> bit in there, because our position moves around <i>a lot</i> so we need to interpolate it lots of times to make it accurate.)
    </li>
    <li>[5]
      Plot at least three shapes that are not circles, and use them to play the song "Hot Cross Buns". You'll probably need to look up the frequency and duration of the notes.
