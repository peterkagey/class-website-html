<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The grade in this course is intended to reflect your learning, growth, and hard work.
</p>
<p>
  Spending time working on problems is essentially the only way to learn mathematics deeply. As such, homework will constitute 40% of the credit in this class.
</p>
<p>
  Homework assignments will be graded within one week of the due date, with an arbitrary subset of the problems graded for correctness and the rest graded for completeness.
</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>
  The homework will be due every Thursday at 8PM. Homework is expected to be typed up using \(\LaTeX\) and submitted via Gradescope. (I will accept handwritten homework upon request.)
</p>
<p>
  The homework is intended to take 200 minutes or less each week. (According to the course catalog <a href="https://catalog.cpp.edu/content.php?catoid=69&navoid=5945#Credit_Hour">you should be spending six hours</a> outside of class each week for a three credit class.) Please let me know as soon as possible if you spend more than 200 minutes on an assignment or more than six hours on out-of-class student work in a week.
</p>
<p>
  You are encouraged to collaborate with other classmates on your homework assignments, provided you acknowledge any assistance given or received. Assignments must be written up individually.
</p>
<h3 id="term-paper-blog-post">Term paper (blog post)</h3>
<p>
  From weeks 7&ndash;13, you will be working on a short paper on a topic of your choosing. The papers are intended to be open-ended explorations related to any ideas from the course that you were curious to learn more about. You will be in a group of classmates writing on the same (or similar) topics, but you will write independently. You will post your writing (pseudonymously, if requested) on a class blog.
</p>
<h3 id="project">Project</h3>
<p>
  We will spend the last two weeks of the term working with your term paper group to make a Numberphile-style video about the topic you wrote about. During the last week of the term, we will watch the videos as a class and your group will take questions from your classmates.
</p>
<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>
  We will be discussing ideas and working on problems collaboratively in this class, so as such, attendance is required, and will be reflected in the "participation" portion of the course grade. If you are unable to make it to class, you are encouraged to notify the instructor ahead of time in order to have the absence excused.
</p>
<h3 id="make-up-homework">Make-up homework</h3>
<p>
  On request, you can redo homework exercises for full credit. In order to redo a problem, you will be asked to either re-submit a thorough answer-key write-up or create a video explaining your solution to other students in the class.
</p>
<h3 id="late-work-and-extensions">Late work and extensions</h3>
<p>
  You can email me at any point in the term to request homework extensions. Please include a proposed extension date, and please let me know if I can help to provide extra support to help keep you on track.
</p>
<p>
  Late homework is accepted with a 1-point-per day penalty beyond the extension date. A late assignment can still receive full credit through the inclusion of additional choice exercise problems.
</p>
<h2 id="class-policies">Class policies</h2>
<h3 id="academic-honesty-and-the-student-conduct-code">Academic Honesty and the Student Conduct Code</h3>
<p>
  My goal for this class is for you to learn and grow, and your academic honesty is a crucial part of ensuring that happens. In this course, you are encouraged to ask for extensions when you need them, and you will be allowed to re-submit homework for full credit.
</p>
<p>
  You are encouraged to collaborate with other students, come to drop-in hours, ask questions in class, and reach out to me via email when you need help with completing homework assignments or understanding course content. When submitting work done in collaboration with others, acknowledge their contributions, and write up the ideas in your own words.
</p>
<p>
  In this course, you <i>are</i> permitted to use tools such as generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT), Question and Answer sites (e.g. Math StackExchange), and other online resources (e.g. Google, GitHub) <b>given that you acknowledge your use of these tools whenever they impact your written work.</b>
</p>
<p>
  If it appears to me that students are using these tools in a way that undermines their learning or engagement, I may ask individual students to stop using these tools.
</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<h3 id="disability-resource-center">Disability Resource Center</h3>
<p>
  Many students have disabilities both visible and invisible. If you have a disability, I encourage you to reach out to the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/drc/index.shtml">Disability Resource Center</a> to coordinate specific accommodations.
If there are any changes that I can make this course more accessible to you, I am eager to work with you&mdash;please reach out to me via email, after class, or in drop-in hours.
</p>
<h3 id="care-center">Care Center</h3>
<p>
  <i>The <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/broncoscarecenter/">Care Center</a> is a first-stop location for any student seeking assistance with basic needs and wellbeing services.</i>
</p>
<p>
  The Care Center can help students who need access to Housing Resources, Food Resources, Financial Resources, Clothing Assistance, Advocacy and Support, and Case Management.
</p>
<h3 id="centers-for-transformation-retention-equity-and-empowerment-tree">Centers for Transformation, Retention, Equity and Empowerment (TREE)</h3>
<p>
  <i>The Centers for Transformation, Retention, Equity and Empowerment create culturally engaging community spaces to validate and elevate our students' identities, lived experiences, and cultural wealth. We use cultural and identity-based retention frameworks to support the empowerment of our students as they actualize their educational, personal, and career goals.</i>
</p>
<p>TREE is made up of six unique Cultural and Identity Centers: Asian and Pacific Islander Student Center, Black Resource Center, César E. Chávez Center for Higher Education, Native American Student Center, Pride Center, and Womxn's Resource Center.
</p>
<h3 id="the-learning-resource-center">The Learning Resource Center</h3>
<p>
  <i>The Learning Resource Center's mission is to promote student success by providing programs and services that advance students' critical thinking, problem solving, and analytical skills.</i>
